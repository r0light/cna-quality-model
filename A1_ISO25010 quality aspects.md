# ISO 25010 characteristics and subcharacteristics

* Functional suitability
  * Functional Appropriateness (facilitate specified tasks and objectives)
  * Functional Correctness (correct results with needed precision)
  * Functional Completeness (functions cover specified tasks and objectives)
* Security
  * Confidentiality (data only accessible to those required)
  * Integrity (prevent unauthorized access or manipulation)
  * Non-repudiation (actions can be proven to have taken place)
  * Accountability (trace actions to an entity)
  * Authenticity (ability to identify a subject and validate claims)
* Maintainability
  * Modularity (compose the system in a way that a change has minimal impact on other components)
  * Reusability (asset can be used in more than one system)
  * Analysability (assess the impact of a change; diagnose for causes of failure)
  * Modifiability (modify without introducing defects; independence of modules is important)
  * Testability (test critera can be established and tests can be performed)
* Performance efficiency
  * Time-behaviour (response times, processing times, throughput rate)
  * Resource utilisation (utilization of resources, disk, cpu, memory, network)
  * Capability (degree to which maximum limits of a system meets requirements, concurrent users)
* Portability
  * Adaptability (adapt to different software/hardware/environment)
  * Installability (install or uninstall in a specific environment)
  * Replaceability (replace another product with the same purpose)
* Usability
  * Appropriateness (recognize appropriateness according to needs)
  * Recognisability
  * Learnability (learn to use the system in an easy way)
  * Operability (operate and control a system)
  * User error protection (protect users from making errors)
  * User interface aesthetics (pleasant and satisfying interactions)
  * Accessibility (usable by pepple with different capabilities)
* Reliability
  * Availability (system is accessible when needed)
  * Fault tolerance (operate as intended while experiencing failures)
  * Recoverability (capability to recover to the intended state after a failure occured)
  * Maturity (reliability under normal operation)
* Compatibility
  * Co-existence (run while sharing environment and resources with other systems)
  * Interoperability (exchange information, protocols)
