# Cloud-native applications Quality Model

This is the accompanying repository to the paper "Towards a Quality Model for Cloud-native applications".

Using the shown methodology, we have developed an initial quality model for cloud-native applications based on the [Quamoco meta model](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1110600/file.pdf)
