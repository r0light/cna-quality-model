  abstract={The prevalence of microservice architectures and container orchestration technologies increases the complexity of assessing such systems' resilience. Chaos engineering is an emerging approach for resilience assessment by testing hypotheses after intentionally injecting faults into a distributed system and observing customer- and business-affecting metrics. As the number of potential risks within a complex system is high, the identification and prioritization of effective and efficient chaos experiments are non-trivial. In the scope of an industrial case study, this work investigates means to identify and prioritize chaos experiments by using established risk analysis techniques known from engineering safety-critical systems, namely i) Fault Tree Analysis, ii) Failure Mode and Effects Analysis, iii) and Computer Hazard and Operability Study. We conducted semi-structured interviews to elicit architectural information and resilience requirements of the case study system. The extracted knowledge was leveraged during the application of the risk analysis techniques. A subset of the identified and prioritized risks was used to create and execute chaos experiments. The risk analysis resulted in over 100 findings and revealed that the system is rather fragile as it comprises a high amount of single points of failure. The chaos experiments revealed further weaknesses for formerly unknown system behavior.},

  abstract={Despite the advantages of microservice and function-oriented architectures, there is an increase in complexity to monitor such highly dynamic systems. In this paper, we analyze two distinct methods to tackle the monitoring problem in a system with reduced instrumentation. Our goal is to understand the feasibility of such approach with one specific driver: simplicity. We aim to determine the extent to which it is possible to characterize the state of two generic tandem processes, using as little information as possible. To answer this question, we resorted to a simulation approach. Using a queue system, we simulated two services, that we could manipulate with distinct operation sets for each module. We used the total response time seen upstream of the system. Having this setup and metric, we applied two distinct methods to analyze the results. First, we used supervised machine learning algorithms to identify where the bottleneck is happening. Secondly, we used an exponential decomposition to identify the occupation in the two components in a more black-box fashion. Results show that both methodologies have their advantages and limitations. The separation of the signal more accurately identifies occupation in low occupied resources, but when a service is totally dominating the overall time, it lacks precision. The machine learning has a more stable error, but needs the training set. This study suggest that a black-box occupation approach with both techniques is possible and very useful.},

  abstract={Smart building management systems become very popular research topics due to high energy consumption of buildings in developed countries. Proposed approaches in the literature commonly focus on smart building energy management systems to improve this high consumption and on network communications between deployed devices. However, these approaches are specialized for a single monitoring application, and adopt static wireless sensor device configurations. In this study, we focus on the energy and lifetime of the monitoring architecture itself. We consider a monitoring system as a set of applications that exploit sensor measures in real-time, where these applications are declaratively expressed as (service-oriented) continuous queries over sensor data streams. We tackle the optimization of interactions between application real-time requirements for data and wireless sensor devices that produces those data. In this context, we present a novel approach, an energy-aware dynamic sensor configuration mechanism for a sustainable declarative monitoring architecture that can support multiple applications. We first introduce formalization of application requirements and sensor configuration based on data acquisition/transmission and continuous stream queries. We then propose a self-adaptive energy-aware algorithm that dynamically generates optimized sensor configurations based on real-time query requirements. We also present a Smart-Service Stream-oriented Sensor Management (3SoSM) Gateway that optimizes sensor configurations and manages sensor data streams. Finally, we present a set of experiments we conducted with a wireless sensor network simulator and with a real Smart Building platform.},

  abstract={In software development, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and creative computing can be adopted to utilize multiple-domain knowledges to construct service software possessing creative properties, i.e., novel, useful, and surprising. In the past, several theoretical evaluation metrics have been proposed to measure creativity of a software system. However, a systematic practical method to construct creative service software is rarely considered in current researches. In this paper, we propose a model for creative service software development based on semantic web, which is applied in two phases: domain-creative requirement specification and semantic-based service design. The model can reduce communication work between domain experts and software engineers, improve traceability of the specifications, and improve machine readability during the generation of creativity. After the model of service design is validated for completeness and consistency, the creative service software is well-designed and can be implemented and reused effectively without losing of creativity.},

  abstract={Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Software Product Line (SPL) have individually proven to be Software Engineering concepts, which are creating values for developing software systems. While SOA is being used for developing applications from an orchestration of web services, SPL has ability to prepare core sets of assets and manage with variable components. The combination of SOA and SPL has highlighted the term of Service Oriented Product Line (SOPL) which is setting up the application to manage common parts and reuse them without developing from scratch. It helps to manage service component bundles dynamically according to identified commonalities and variabilities. In this paper, we present our implementation approach of SOPL and manage Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in such environments by monitoring Quality of Service (QoS) attributes in bundles of web service components. The designing and developing service bundles for representing core sets of assets in SOPL are followed by the initial feature based analysis and identification of service components. Then, the managing SLAs is handled by detecting the deviation between actual and acceptable pre-defined QoS metrics values in previously analysed web service components via Web Service Level Agreement (WSLA) language specified templates.},

  pages={90-97},
  abstract={This paper discusses a new approach for designing and deploying Security-as-a-Service (SecaaS) applications using cloud native design patterns. Current SecaaS approaches do not efficiently handle the increasing threats to computer systems and applications. For example, requests for security assessments drastically increase after a high-risk security vulnerability is disclosed. In such scenarios, SecaaS applications are unable to dynamically scale to serve requests. A root cause of this challenge is employment of architectures not specifically fitted to cloud environments. Cloud native design patterns resolve this challenge by enabling certain properties e.g. massive scalability and resiliency via the combination of microservice patterns and cloud-focused design patterns. However adopting these patterns is a complex process, during which several security issues are introduced. In this work, we investigate these security issues, we redesign and deploy a monolithic SecaaS application using cloud native design patterns while considering appropriate, layered security counter-measures i.e. at the application and cloud networking layer. Our prototype implementation out-performs traditional, monolithic applications with an average Scanner Time of 6 minutes, without compromising security. Our approach can be employed for designing secure, scalable and performant SecaaS applications that effectively handle unexpected increase in security assessment requests.},

  abstract={The ongoing digitization of cities, enabled by the diffusion of interconnected sensors and devices, makes it possible to continuously collect and analyze huge streams of data at extremely large spatio-temporal scales and fine resolutions. These data can be used to monitor, detect and anticipate different kinds of infrastructure vulnerabilities and anomalies, as well as to implement more personalized services that could improve citizens' life. In this new context, full of opportunities, it is difficult to foresee and develop, in advance, the set of applications and services that can be potentially useful for administrators and citizens to solve the manifold compelling needs a city may have to face. Novel ICT paradigms and technologies can help designing agile, general-purpose smart city platforms aimed at supporting the collection and treatment of large-scale, multi-source (streams of) data and the development of novel applications that could fulfill diverse functional requirements under strict non-functional constraints. This paper presents the reference architecture, a prototype implementation and a city-scale case-study evaluation of PROMENADE, a platform that exploits IoT/Fog/Cloud paradigms, microservices and DevOps infrastructures to guarantee continuous development of robust and reliable applications for real-time monitoring and analysis of traffic data generated by IoT devices in large smart cities. The prototype has been evaluated in a case study concerning the quasi real-time detection of road networks vulnerabilities via centrality measures from on-line traffic conditions, emulated from off-line real datasets available for the city of Lyon, France.},

  pages={61-66},
  abstract={E-commerce marketplaces are highly dynamic with constant competition. While this competition is challenging for many merchants, it also provides plenty of opportunities, e.g., by allowing them to automatically adjust prices in order to react to changing market situations. For practitioners however, testing automated pricing strategies is time-consuming and potentially hazardously when done in production. Researchers, on the other side, struggle to study how pricing strategies interact under heavy competition. As a consequence, we built an open continuous time framework to simulate dynamic pricing competition called Price Wars. The microservice-based architecture provides a scalable platform for large competitions with dozens of merchants and a large random stream of consumers. Our platform stores each event in a distributed log. This allows to provide different performance measures enabling users to compare profit and revenue of various repricing strategies in real-time. For researchers, price trajectories are shown which ease evaluating mutual price reactions of competing strategies. Furthermore, merchants can access historical marketplace data and apply machine learning. By providing a set of customizable, artificial merchants, users can easily simulate both simple rule-based strategies as well as sophisticated data-driven strategies using demand learning to optimize their pricing strategies.},

  volume={},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={In recent years, there is an increasing demand for indoor localization services with the aim to locate people and objects inside buildings. However, localization accuracy is susceptible to inaccurate and high variant sensor measurements due to the unpredictable fluctuations of received wireless signals and the sensitivity of hardware devices. To address this issue, in this paper, we establish a new Bluetooth indoor localization system, whose architecture can be basically decomposed into two parts: the internet-of-things (IoT) framework and the localization module. Concretely, the IoT platform uses the state-of-the-art light weight Spring Boot microservice framework consisting of multi-layer structure. In the localization module, it follows the general process of trilateration but significantly distinguished from it. A set of measures are adopted to strengthen the system's robustness when obtained measurements cannot be fully trusted. Specifically, in the first place, rather than using conventional propagation model to predict the distance between Bluetooth transmitter and receiver, we design a bran-new LSTM-based distance estimator which can better depict the nonlinearity of attenuation characteristics of radio signal. Moreover, we also employ a series of self-adaptive mechanisms, including elastic radius intersecting, multiple weighted centroid localization and self-adaptive Kalman tracking, to make the system robust against inaccurate measurements and unpredictable sudden variation of received wireless signal. A bunch of tests are conducted in both ideal lab environment and Alibaba's large-scale warehouse, and experimental results show our indoor localization system outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmarks by a large margin in both localization accuracy and stability.},

The backend system must be able to cope with the high throughput data and carry out possibly heavy computations for the detection of anomalous behavior via artificial intelligence techniques. This sets certain performance and architectural requirements on the design of the backend.In the paper, we discuss our design and implementation choices for the backend of SOD that involve microservices and serverless services to achieve efficiency and scalability. We give evidence of the achieved goals by deploying the SOD backend on a public cloud and measuring the performance on simulated load tests.},

  abstract={Software size measurement is critical as an input to perform important project management processes such as effort, cost and schedule estimation. Functional size measurement (FSM) methods are beneficial in terms of being applicable in the early phases of the software life cycle over functional requirements and providing a systematic and repeatable method. However, in agile organizations, it can be challenging to seperate measurement components of FSM methods from requirements in the early phases as the documentation is kept to a minimum compared to traditional methods such as the Waterfall Model and is detailed as the project steps. In addition, the existing FSM methods are not fully compatible with today&#x0027;s architectural structures, which are from being data-driven and to evolve into a behaviour-oriented structure. In this study, we performed a case study which includes a project developed with agile methods and using microservice-based architecture to compare the effectiveness of COSMIC FSM and event-based software size measurement. For this purpose, we measured the size of the project and created effort estimation models based on two methods. The measurers had difficulty in applying both methods due to the limited detail level of the requirements in the project. However, the event-based method was found to estimate effort with less error than the COSMIC FSM method.},

  abstract={Cloud Computing has emerged into an inevitable platform for computing services by effectively implementing Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Virtualization. However it is still vulnerable to traditional security threats and offers scope for innovative security attacks such as EDoS [1]. While it offers platform to generate innumerable Virtual components from a single physical component, it inadvertently provides wide spectrum of possibilities for distributed attacks. Moreover such attacks have adapted to cloud platform and have exploited various inherent vulnerabilities. In an unprecedented manner, they became unpredictable, evasive and challenging to Cloud Security measures. Therefore various versions of DDoS attack that targets the cloud platform have been extensively researched and narrated. The Cloud Security faces unprecedented challenges such as the Single-point-of-Failure occurs when a Cloud Supervisory Component or hypervisor fails due to a security breach. Moreover Cloud requirements often require being liberal to meet the Clients needs. This does not help the CSP to adapt traditional stringent security measures in Cloud System the reasons have been discussed in details.},

  abstract={A Cloud-based Service-Oriented Architecture (CBSOA) is typically composed of web services, which are offered off the cloud marketplace. CB-SOA can improve its utility and add value to its composition by switching among its constituent services. We look at the option to defer the decision of substitution under uncertainty. We exploit Binomial Options to the formulation. We quantify the time-value of the architecture decisions of switching web services and technical debt they can imply on the structure. As CB-SOA are market-sensitive, dynamic and "volatile", the decision of deferral tends to be sensitive to these dynamics. Henceforth, the structural complexity of a CB-SOAcan change over time and so the technical debt as its constituent web services are modified, replaced, upgraded, etc. The method builds on Design Structure Matrix (DSM) and introduces time and complexity aware propagation cost metrics to assess the value of deferral decisions relative to changes in the structure. Architects of CB-SOA can use our method to assess the time value of deferring the decisions to switch web services relative to complexity, technical debt and value creation. We demonstrate the applicability of the method using an illustrative example.},

  abstract={The world of communications and networking knows and important evolution over the years. While this evolution is concretized by a deployment of many modern protocols at most of protocol layers, the Transport one continues to use old TCP and UDP protocols. This despite that an important number of modern protocols and mechanisms have been proposed. In this context, we study in this paper the obstacle of the deployment of new transport protocols and propose a new architecture to support the deployment and the adaptation of new Transport solutions. This was achieved by adding extensibility and adaptability capabilities using service-oriented and component-based paradigms. The architecture performances are studied at the end to measure the impact and the benefits of the new architecture comparing to classical Transport protocol.},

  abstract={Cloud patterns are described as good solutions to recurring design problems in a cloud context. These patterns are often inherited from Service Oriented Architectures or Object Oriented Architectures where they are considered good practices. However, there is a lack of studies that assess the benefits of these patterns for cloud applications. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on a Restful application deployed in the cloud, to investigate the individual and the combined impact of three cloud patterns (i.e., Local Database proxy, Local Sharding-Based Router and Priority Queue Patterns) on Quality of Service (QoS). We measure the QoS using the application's response time, average, and maximum number of requests processed per seconds. Results show that cloud patterns doesn't always improve the response time of an application. In the case of the Local Database proxy pattern, the choice of algorithm used to route requests has an impact on response time, as well as the average and maximum number of requests processed per second. Combinations of patterns can significantly affect the QoS of applications. Developers and software architects can make use of these results to guide their design decisions.},

  abstract={Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural style that supports service orientation. In reality, SOA is much more than architecture. SOA adoption is prerequisite for organization to excel their service deliveries, as the delivery platforms are shifting to mobile, cloud and social media. A maturity model is a tool to accelerate enterprise SOA adoption, however it depends on how it should be applied. This paper presents a literature review of existing maturity models and proposes 5 major aspects that a maturity model has to address to improve SOA practices of an enterprise. A maturity model can be used as: (i) a roadmap for SOA adoption, (ii) a reference guide for SOA adoption, (iii) a tool to gauge maturity of process execution, (iv) a tool to measure the effectiveness of SOA motivations, and (v) a review tool for governance framework. This paper also sheds light on how SOA maturity assessment can be modeled. A model for SOA process execution maturity and perspective maturity assessment has been proposed along with a framework to include SOA scope of adoption.},

  abstract={In service oriented architectures, components provide services on their output ports and consume services from other components on their input ports. Thereby, a component is said to depend on another component if the former consumes a service provided by the latter. This notion of dependency (which we call syntactic dependency) is used by many architecture analysis tools as a measure for system maintainability. With this paper, we introduce a weaker notion of dependency, still sufficient, however, to guarantee semantic independence between components. Thereby, we discover the concepts of weak and strong semantic dependency and prove that strong semantic dependency indeed implies syntactic dependency. Our alternative notion of dependency paves the way to more precise dependency analysis tools. Moreover, our results about the different types of dependencies can be used for the verification of semantic independence.},

  abstract={The existing radio monitoring practices suffer from two critical limitations: 1) current practices have been limited to isolated measuring and are unable to integrate data from different spectrum sensors; 2) these practices still require human operators to interpret signals, which prevent automated and intelligent processing. To address these limitations, we present a novel design of a spectrum sensing node based on the Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture. The spectrum sensing node exploits the REST architecture to integrate resources (data) into the web and to make it effortless to collect and share resources by exposing resources as service-oriented Web APIs. In addition, the spectrum sensing node introduces standardization and automation to radio monitoring. We outline the procedures of spectrum analysis and signal analysis for radio monitoring. Furthermore, to automate spectrum sensing node functionalities, we implement spectrum analysis and signal analysis using machine learning methods, which reliably extract and learn intrinsic features of complex data. The spectrum sensing node has been packaged and deployed in Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture of China for radio spectrum management. We describe and discuss our implemented prototype of the spectrum sensing node to demonstrate its practical advantages.},

  pages={858-867},
  abstract={Service-oriented architectures for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been proposed to provide an integrated platform, where new applications can be rapidly developed through flexible service composition. In WSNs, the existing multipath routing schemes have demonstrated the effectiveness of traffic distribution over multipaths to fulfill the quality of service requirements of applications. However, the failure of links might significantly affect the transmission performance, scalability, reliability, and security of WSNs. Thus, by considering the reliability, congestion control, and security for multipath, it is desirable to design a reliable and service-driven routing scheme to provide efficient and failure-tolerant routing scheme. In this paper, an evaluation metric, path vacant ratio, is proposed to evaluate and then find a set of link-disjoint paths from all available paths. A congestion control and load-balancing algorithm that can adaptively adjust the load over multipaths is proposed. A threshold sharing algorithm is applied to split the packets into multiple segments that will be delivered via multipaths to the destination depending on the path vacant ratio. Simulations demonstrate the performance of the adaptive and secure load-balance routing scheme.},

  volume={},

  pages={59-66},
  abstract={Cloud-based services have become a cornerstone of today's IT. The self-service feature inherent in Cloud systems allows customers to play a greater role in service procurement. However, this restricts the value propositions and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that Cloud providers offer because Quality of Service (QoS) and Non Functional Property (NFP) requirements vary from customer to customer. In feature-rich SLA templates, the contract space gets large, objectives are confidential and preferences over QoS and NFP often conflict between providers and customers. Hence, an SLA-gap exists between the two and contemporary providers bind their offerings to the inflexible take-it-or-leave-it SLAs. In this work, we address this problem by presenting a robust and computationally inexpensive negotiation strategy, using which agents can efficiently create near-optimal SLAs under time constraints. Experimental evaluations validate that our strategy performs at par with state of the art learning and non-learning strategies against a variety of metrics including utility, social welfare, social utility and the Pareto-optimal bids. This enables a dynamic SLA negotiation mechanism on top of our OpenShift (PaaS) based Cloud system designed using Service Oriented Cloud Computing Infrastructure (SOCCI) architecture. Negotiated procurement of services is shown to improve satisfaction of participants and reducing the SLA-gap.},

  abstract={Deep learning has been an emerging field of machine learning during past decades. However, the diversity and large scale data size have posed significant challenge to construct a flexible and high performance implementations of deep learning neural networks. In order to improve the performance as well to maintain the scalability, in this paper we present SOLAR, a services-oriented deep learning architecture using various accelerators like GPU and FPGA. SOLAR provides a uniform programming model to users so that the hardware implementation and the scheduling is invisible to the programmers. At runtime, the services can be executed either on the software processors or the hardware accelerators. To leverage the trade-offs between the metrics among performance, power, energy, and efficiency, we present a multitarget design space exploration. Experimental results on the real state-of-the-art FPGA board demonstrate that the SOLAR is able to provide a ubiquitous framework for diverse applications without increasing the burden of the programmers. Moreover, the speedup of the GPU and FPGA hardware accelerator in SOLAR can achieve significant speedup comparing to the conventional Intel i5 processors with great scalability.},

  abstract={Web service technologies are playing an increasingly important role in service-oriented architecture design and application convergence over Mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). Due to the decentralized administration and dynamic wireless connectivity problems, accomplishing reliable service discovery in MANET faces a large number of challenges. In order to relieve the communication inefficiency among service providers and clients caused mainly by the unpredictable node mobility, this paper proposes a cross-layer service discovery scheme which enables improved network efficiency and reduced resource consumption. Firstly a network-layer based underlay framework is presented. It specifically establishes a reliability-oriented source routing mechanism which is equipped with a novel reliability-maximized path selection metric and a backup path support fast route recovery strategy. The cross-layer design is prudentially realized by piggybacking service discovery procedures on the reliability enhanced underlay routing mechanism. Simulation analysis verifies that the proposed scheme improves service discovery reliability by achieving low rediscovery frequency, and guarantees high network efficiency by providing reduced service discovery delay and control overhead.},

  abstract={The Internet has been evolving from a traditional mechanism to a modern service-oriented architecture, such as quality-of-service (QoS) policies, to meet users’ various requirements for high service quality. An instant and effective network traffic classification method is indispensable to identify network services to enforce QoS policies on the corresponding service. Network managers can easily flexibly deploy traffic classification modules and configure the network policies with the help of the emerging software-defined networking. However, most existing traffic classification solutions, such as port-based methods or deep packet inspection, cannot handle real-time and encrypted traffic classification. In this research, a Convolutional Autoencoder Packet Classifier (CAPC) has been proposed to immediately classify incoming packets in fine-grained and coarse-grained manners, that is, classifying a service to a single application and a rough genre, respectively. The CAPC is a packet-based deep learning model consisting of a 1D convolutional neural network and an autoencoder, which can handle dynamic-port and encrypted traffic and even cluster similar applications. This classifier is verified on not only the private self-captured traffic but also a public VPN dataset to demonstrate its performance. Moreover, the CAPC classifies different types of service traffic with an accuracy of over 99.9% on the private dataset of 16 services and over 97% on the public dataset of 24 services, thereby outperforming other deep learning classifiers. Experimental results also show other performance metrics, including stability, average precision, and recall and the highest F1-score values of 15 and 18 services on the private and public datasets, respectively.},

  abstract={With the advent of the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) in system design, various domain knowledges are included in a service-based application, such as the design of Artificial Intelligence (AI) or augmented reality (AR) systems. While merging one or multiple domains into computation systems, the computation systems can be widely applied in various domain usages with novelty, useful, and surprising properties, which are defined as systems of creative computing. In creative computing, several theoretical evaluation metrics and verification approaches have been proposed for system design in several domains. However, a solid practical design environment for creative service-based systems is rarely considered in current researches. In this paper, we propose a model for creative service software development based on semantic web, which is applied in two phases: (1) requirement specification and (2) service design. In order to bridge the knowledge gap between domain experts and software engineers, and provide a machine-readable format for creative computing, two sub-models, Requirement Specification and Service Structure Models, are constructed in both phases, sequentially. After the latter sub-model is validated, the creative service software is well-constructed based on the services definition and composition represented by the model.},

  abstract={Service-oriented Architecture (SOA) is adopted by many industrial and business organizations, as an efficient means for designing, developing and integrating enterprise business processes applications. With the built of Web Services, the developed business processes can be easily combined to achieve a composite business solution. Generally, any business applications are mixture of processes and some tasks corresponding to the processes. In the planning phase of software project management, estimation of development effort is very critical and crucial for software/business organizations. Having an accurate effort estimate guarantees the managers that the projects are completed within time and budget. So, estimation techniques/models need to be very efficient and should highlights all important cost drivers. The estimation of development effort for business processes primarily depends on the number of processes and it's associated tasks. The development effort of business applications primarily depends on the size of integrated applications. In this paper, some metrics for predicting the size of integrated business process SOA applications have been proposed. After estimating size, the development effort calculated by using the popular COCOMO model. A comparison of various performance evaluation criterion for assessing the accuracy of proposed model has been computed and shown.},

  abstract={Peer to peer (P2P) systems have moved from application specific architectures to a generic service oriented design philosophy. This raised interesting problems in connection with providing useful P2P middleware services capable of dealing with resource assignment and management in a large-scale, heterogeneous and unreliable environment. The slicing problem consists of partitioning a P2P network into $k$  groups (slices) of a given portion of the network nodes that share similar resource values. As the network is large and dynamic this partitioning is continuously updated without any node knowing the network size. In this paper, we propose the first algorithm to solve the slicing problem. We introduce the metric of slice disorder and show that the existing ordering algorithm cannot nullify this disorder. We propose a new algorithm that speeds up the existing ordering algorithm but that suffers from the same inaccuracy. Then, we propose another algorithm based on ranking that is provably convergent under reasonable assumptions. In particular, we notice experimentally that ordering algorithms suffer from resource-correlated churn while the ranking algorithm can cope with it. These algorithms are proved viable theoretically and experimentally.},

  abstract={Cancer Care involves not only handling patients' medical or physical needs but also other services to facilitate patient needs which are underpinned by appropriate software systems that assist in patient care processes. The Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) model of computing has become widely adopted and can provide efficient and agile business solutions in the face of rapid changes to business requirements. Instead of adopting a more traditional way of building an IT system for Cancer Care by rigidly piecing together a collection of hardware, software and networking, SOA offers the opportunity to build the IT systems in an increasingly flexible and reconfigurable way. However, current service identification methods can suffer from shortcomings such as a lack of computational support, and not being able to address all the necessary activities of the service identification. To address these shortcomings, this paper presents a comprehensive metaheuristic search framework for deriving SOA-based services applied to Cancer Care business process models. This framework is evaluated using both quantitative and qualitative methods with the help of domain experts at King Hussein Cancer Centre (KHCC), Jordan. Evaluation by domain experts confirmed that the resulting services are feasible (i.e., valid services that can be practically applied for real-life projects) that the domain experts might not have arrived at manually. Statistical analysis shows candidate services produced by the search-based framework are superior to the services produced manually by domain experts at KHCC with respect to metrics for coupling and cohesion.},

  abstract={Effective service-oriented architecture (SOA) governance requires an appropriate process in place by which services described by a service model become candidates to enter the service portfolio. This is a planning for the appropriate identified services to create business agility and maximize reuse. Not all services in the service model can be realized in the form of IT solutions, so if our intended use of the service portfolio is to drive IT development planning, we must first decide which services are potentially realizable and which services are not. In this paper, we present a decision model to evaluate the services based on the proposed metrics. Comparing the relative value of each service with its development or maintenance cost should make the prioritization. The decision model is useful to support an approach to identifying the optimum portfolio of services based on the prioritization of business needs, followed by an estimation of the technical feasibility for each candidate service.},

  abstract={Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an architectural paradigm that advocates composition of loosely-coupled services in order to construct more complex applications. The agility and complexity of modern web services on one hand and the arbitrary interconnections among them on the other hand, make it difficult to maintain a sustainable trustworthiness in long-running SOA-based applications. Moreover, the chain of participating services in a specific SOA invocation may not be visible to the service consumers, which leads to a lack of accountability. To address these challenges in SOA, we propose the following contributions. First, we design a new dynamic and flexible trust model based on graph abstraction that uses multiple trust strategies to calculate trust across SOA. This trust model keeps track of three trust metrics: individual service trust, session trust, and composite trust. We further design a trust engine component that implements the proposed trust model and that continuously maintains the quantitative end-to-end trust based on processing actual execution of services. Second, to prove the practicality and usefulness of the proposed framework, we have implemented an adaptive and secure service composition engine (ASSC) which takes advantage of an efficient algorithm to generate service compositions with near-optimal trustworthiness under predefined QoS constraints. Finally, we have developed a tool that is able to automatically deploy SOA testbeds from arbitrary directed acyclic graphs (created in the GUI). This tool enables the researcher to study the dynamics of new trust algorithms and strategies under different scenarios (e.g., arbitrary SOA topologies and attacks). We have extensively studied the effectiveness and performance of the proposed solutions using testbeds in the Amazon EC2 cloud.},

In this context, we propose a two-layer architecture for analyzing IoT data. The first layer provides a generic interface using a service oriented gateway to ingest data from multiple interfaces and IoT systems, store it in a scalable manner and analyze it in real-time to extract high-level events; whereas second layer is responsible for probabilistic fusion of these high-level events. In the second layer, we extend state-of-the-art event processing using Bayesian networks in order to take uncertainty into account while detecting complex events. We implement our proposed solution using open source components optimized for large-scale applications. We demonstrate our solution on real-world use-case in the domain of intelligent transportation system where we analyzed traffic, weather, and social media data streams from Madrid city in order to predict probability of congestion in real-time. The performance of the system is evaluated qualitatively using a web-interface where traffic administrators can provide the feedback about the quality of predictions and quantitatively using F-measure with an accuracy of over 80%.},

  abstract={Telemonitoring is a branch of telehealth that aims at remotely monitoring vital signs, which is important for chronically ill patients and the elderly living alone. The available standalone devices and applications for the self-monitoring of health parameters largely suffer from interoperability problems; meanwhile, telemonitoring medical devices are expensive, self-contained, and are not integrated into user-friendly technological platforms for the end user. This paper presents the technical aspects and usability assessment of the telemonitoring features of the HEREiAM platform, which supports heterogeneous information technology systems. By exploiting a service-oriented architecture, the measured parameters collected by off-the-shelf Bluetooth medical devices are sent as XML documents to a private cloud that implements an interoperable health service infrastructure, which is compliant with the most recent healthcare standards and security protocols. This Android-based system is designed to be accessible both via TV and portable devices, and includes other utilities designed to support the elderly living alone. Four usability assessment sessions with quality-validated questionnaires were performed to accurately understand the ease of use, usefulness, acceptance, and quality of the proposed system. The results reveal that our system achieved very high usability scores even at its first use, and the scores did not significantly change over time during a field trial that lasted for four months, reinforcing the idea of an intuitive design. At the end of such a trial, the user-experience questionnaire achieved excellent scores in all aspects with respect to the benchmark. Good results were also reported by general practitioners who assessed the quality of their remote interfaces for telemonitoring.},

  abstract={The NATO research task group IST-118 titled “SOA recommendations for disadvantaged grids in the tactical domain” is addressing the challenge of implementing the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) paradigm at the tactical level by providing guidance and best practices in the form of a Tactical SOA Profile. The group will conduct identification and feasibility assessments of possible improvements of the Tactical SOA Profile, over a series of live and emulated experiments. In this paper, we describe our first experiments in applying SOA Web services to mobile nodes that are connected using Wireless Broadband Mobile Networks (WBMN) in the tactical domain. The experiments involved components provided by various nations, including radio hardware equipment, the Publish/Subscribe messaging service and NATO Friendly Force Information (NFFI) (as our functional service). We measured the system performance at service and physical (radio) levels in the presence of network disruption. We conclude by presenting the results of the experiments and a view of future work.},

  year={2018},
  volume={11},

  pages={602-615},
  abstract={With the increasing volume of data to be analysed, one of the challenges in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is to make web services efficient in processing large-scale data. Parallel execution and cloud technologies are the keys to speed-up the service invocation. In SOA, service providers typically employ policies to limit parallel execution of the services based on arbitrary decisions. In order to attain optimal performance improvement, users need to adapt to the services policies. A composite service is a combination of several atomic services provided by various providers. To use parallel execution for greater composite service efficiency, the degree of parallelism (DOP) of the composite services need to be optimized by considering the policies of all atomic services. We propose a model that embeds service policies into formulae to calculate composite service performance. From the calculation, we predict the optimal DOP for the composite service, where it attains the best performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world translation services. We use several measures such as mean prediction error (MPE), mean absolute deviation (MAD) and tracking signal (TS) to evaluate our model. The analysis results show that our proposed model has good prediction accuracy in identifying optimal DOPs for composite services.},

  abstract={NATO has identified the WS-Notification standard from OASIS to support event-driven communication in the NATO enterprise and when building coalition networks. Using this standard promotes interoperability. However, there is significant overhead associated with WS-Notification since it is built on SOAP Web services (WS). Overhead can be problematic in networks with scarce resources. In this paper we perform a small-scale comparative evaluation of overhead of WS-Notification with another publish/subscribe standard: Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT). We also measure how these standards compare to the novel approach of content-based networking under the same networking conditions. We use the Named Data Networking (NDN) flavor of content-based networking for our experiment. Though fundamentally different, these approaches can be used to realize the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) paradigm. The drawback of standard publish/subscribe approaches is that they usually rely on a broker, which constitutes a single point of failure. NDN, on the other hand, has no broker which makes it interesting to consider for tactical networks. We use NATO Friendly Force Information (NFFI), which is much used for friendly force tracking, as the data format for the payload in all our tests. In the paper we focus on the respective approaches' network resource consumption. Based on the results we argue that the content-based approach seems promising and should be investigated further.},

  abstract={Explosions in coal mines during the work time is a one of major cause of casualties in the coal mines. Thus possess a life threaten situation for coal miners. In this paper we propose a system in which sensors sense concentration of gases (Methane and carbon monoxide) in the air, measures the mine temperature and humidity and heartbeat of miner. In response it generate the alerts, and identifies the location of miners. We propose ZigBee based wireless sensor network (WSN) for communication between sensors and coal mine safety monitoring system. The iBeacons are proposed for identification of miners. A service oriented architecture (SOA) has used to develop the system. The main purpose of this research paper is to ensure miners safety, by predicting the methane has with artificial neural network (ANN). The application of ANN seems more viable than others, the calculated values shows that its prove a negligible relative error that is around 0.05.. than the actual measurements. The proposed work is then compared with the state-of-the-art methods that overcomes the limitations form the existing systems.},

  abstract={Statistical are identical to conducting surveys. The process of conducting a survey is still not in accordance with the stages of planning, so that the impact on business processes is not maximized from the entire survey. The implementation of the project management system in statistical is expected to improve the control function in the survey. As information technology develops, service concepts can improve project management systems. Project management services make every component in project management work effectively and efficiently. Project management services develop in the addition of features, technology and resources. So there needs to be a system that can accommodate these needs by having functions that can be expanded. The service computing platform is the answer to this problem. A service computing platform is an architecture designed to support the process of preparing web services, and can provide tools and techniques for modeling, simulating, analyzing, planning, providing and monitoring service-oriented applications in real time. This platform can also be used as a basis for implementing various surveys. Statistics Indonesia (SI) needs to make improvements in conducting surveys. In line with the increasing quality of data produced by SI, it is necessary to develop a service computing platform for statistical project management. This study proposes a service computing platform using the Service Computing System Engineering (SCSE) methodology. After getting the service computing platform design, the proposed design is evaluated. Design evaluation is measured by Coupling Factor 0.0034 (loose coupling), Cohesion Factor 0.9198 (high cohesion), Complexity Factor 0.00368 (low complexity) and Reusability Factor 5.28571 (reusable) indicating that the design value is quite good.},

  abstract={Clinical Sleep Research is an inherent multidisciplinary field, as many health issues may affect a person's sleep conditions and sleep disorders may cause several health problems. Many patients with chronic sleep disorders suffer from different further medical conditions - called multimorbidity. Due to the high variety of the reasons and the courses of sleep disorders, individual cases are difficult to compare. Therefore there is a high demand for sleep researchers to collaborate with each other to reach necessary participant numbers and multidisciplinary expertise. To date, inter-institutional sleep research is poorly supported by IT systems. In particular the heterogeneity and the quality variations within the acquired bio signal data - caused by different bio signal recorders or different measurement procedures - are impeding common bio signal data processing. In this manuscript we introduce a virtual research platform supporting inter-institutional data sharing and processing. The infrastructure is based on XNAT - a free and open-source neuroimaging research platform - a loosely coupled service oriented architecture and scalable virtualization in the backend. The system is capable of local pseudonymization of bio signal data, mapping to a standardized set of parameters and automatic quality assessment. Terms and quality measures are derived from the "Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events" of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, the de-facto standard for diagnostic bio signal analysis in sleep medicine.},

  abstract={This paper studies heuristic search-based optimization of service compositions. We have investigated applying Genetic Algorithms (GA) to optimize service-oriented architectures (SOA) in terms of security goals and cost, we help software Engineers to map the optimized service composition to the business process model based on security and cost. Service composition security risk is measured by implementing the aggregation rules from the local security risk values of the aggregated services in the composition. We adapt the DREAD model for Security risk assessment by suggesting new categorizations for calculating DREAD factors based on a proposed service structure and service attributes. We implemented the YAFA-SOA Optimizer as an extension of an existing GA implementation to solve multi-objective optimization problems for varying number of objectives in the context of SOA. We evaluated the tool in a case study. The study results show that applying multi-objective GA is feasible to find the optimized security and cost in SOA-based systems. We were able to approve that adding security services to the generated composition reduces the risk severity of the generated composition and enhances its security in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA). We found that the generated service composition risk severity is less than 0.5, which matches the validation results obtained from a security expert.},

  abstract={Today, process-aware systems are ubiquitous. They are built by leveraging process languages for both business and implementation perspectives. In the typical context of a Web Services-based Service-oriented Architecture, the obvious choice to implement service orchestrations is still the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL). For BPEL, a variety of open source and commercial engines have emerged. Although the BPEL standard document defines a set of static analysis rules which should be checked by engines prior to deployment to be standard conformant, previous work revealed that most engines are not capable of revealing all violations of these constraints, resulting in costly runtime errors later on. In this paper, we aim to improve the static analysis conformance of BPEL engines. We implement the tool BPELlint that validates 71 static analysis rules of the BPEL specification, show that the tool can be easily integrated into the deployment process of existing engines, and evaluate its performance to measure the effect on the time to deploy. The results demonstrate that BPELlint can improve the static analysis conformance of BPEL engines with an acceptable performance overhead.},

  abstract={The increasing use of cloud computing, constructed on good research in utility computing, networking, virtualization and web services provides some important benefits such as flexibility, cost reduction and easy availability for people using the system. These advantages are expected to increase the demand for more cloud services which further increase the installation of more clouds and its customer base. These demands lead to many technical issues such as applications of internet services, service oriented architecture including high scalability and availability, fault tolerance. So the core issue is to develop techniques for balancing of load effectively. It is clear from the fact that the measure and complexity makes these systems infeasible for assignment of centralized jobs to specific servers. So there is need of productive distributed solutions. In the current paper three proposed load balancing solutions for distributed environment is investigated. They are biased Random Sampling, Honeybee Foraging and Active Clustering.},
