abstract = {Round robin (RR) is a widely adopted scheduling policy in modern computer systems. The scheduler handles the concurrency by alternating the run processes in such a way that they can use the processor continuously for at most a quantum of time. When the processor is assigned to another process, a context switch occurs. Although modern architectures handle context switches quite efficiently, the processes may incur in some indirect costs mainly due to cache overwriting.RR is widely appreciated both in case of interactive and CPU intensive processes. In the latter case, with respect to the First-Come-First-Served approach (FCFS), RR does not penalise the small jobs.In this paper, we study a scheduling policy, namely PS-FCFS, that fixes a maximum level of parallelism N and leaves the remaining jobs in a FCFS queue. The idea is that of exploiting the advantages of RR without incurring in heavy slowdowns because of context switches.We propose a queueing model for PS-FCFS allowing us to: (i) find the optimal level of multiprogramming and (ii) study important properties of this policy such as the mean performance measures and results about its sensitivity to the moments of the jobs' service demands.},

abstract = {Data centers need to monitor various metrics of their different application platforms and applications in real-time. As the system architectures and application services of different application platforms within them become more complex, the requirements for their anomaly detection capabilities are higher. Therefore, this paper proposes an anomaly detection framework based on data center operation and maintenance data. The framework in this paper consists of three parts, including operation and maintenance data cleaning, data feature extraction, and model routing. It is used to select the appropriate model through model routing based on the indicators such as stability and periodicity obtained from data feature extraction of each application platform. At the same time, in order to enhance the expansion capability of the detection algorithm, a cloud-ground hybrid framework is used and a module for algorithm model management is designed to facilitate interaction with the cloud. After testing on SWAT and WADI datasets, the anomaly detection algorithm with the addition of model routing in the framework has good accuracy and recall performance compared to a single anomaly algorithm model, showing advantages in the task of identifying anomalies.},

abstract = {This paper presents the experience in the implementation and application of a large-scale Indoor Location-Based Service (LBS) in an academic library. We deployed an indoor positioning system within the school library that leverages 550 Bluetooth beacons, covering an area of approximately 12,000 square meters. This system allows users to engage with location-aware book navigation services via a web interface on their mobile devices. Upon locating a book of interest, the system enters navigation mode, updating and guiding users based on their current location within the library. Utilizing the users’ positional data and borrowing history, the system is capable of recommending other potentially interesting books, exhibits, and library events. The system went live in February 2023, with a recorded usage sessions of 21,540 instances which includes 17,271 uses of the retrieval services and 2,065 indoor navigation services, as of May 2023. This paper outlines the system architecture of this large-scale indoor LBS, shares user engagement data, and after anonymization, makes this data publicly available for academic analysis and research. We are hoping that our experience can shed light on the understanding and future development of large-scale indoor LBS technologies.},

abstract = {More than 150 cellular networks worldwide have rolled out massive IoT services such as smart metering and environmental monitoring. Such cellular IoT services share the existing cellular network architecture with non-IoT (e.g., smartphone) ones. When they are newly integrated into the cellular network, new security vulnerabilities may happen from imprudent integration. In this work, we explore the security vulnerabilities of the cellular IoT from both system-integrated and service-integrated aspects. We discover five vulnerabilities spanning cellular standard design defects, network operation slips, and IoT device implementation flaws. Threateningly, they allow an adversary to remotely identify IP addresses and phone numbers assigned to cellular IoT devices and launch data/text spamming attacks against them. We experimentally validate these vulnerabilities and attacks with three major U.S. IoT carriers. The attack evaluation result shows that the adversary can raise an IoT data bill by up to $226 with less than 120 MB spam traffic and increase an IoT text bill at a rate of $5 per second; moreover, cellular IoT devices may suffer from denial of IoT services. We finally propose, prototype, and evaluate recommended solutions.},

Mobile WiMAX enables low-cost mobile internet applications, realizes the convergence of mobile and fixed broadband access in single air interface and network architecture. Although Mobile WiMAX has a lot of features such as high data rate, quality of service, scalability, high security and of course mobility, there are some problems that can be identified within the network; two major problems include signal interference and network coverage. In this paper, Mobile WiMAX Network Optimization is implemented to improve the interference control, enable effective coverage and enhance user experience to meet new business development needs and maximize profits. The paper is supported by measured real data captured in an urban environment using vehicular drive tests and other tools.

abstract = {A geospatial database is today at the core of an ever increasing number of services. Building and maintaining it remains challenging due to the need to merge information from multiple providers. Entity Resolution (ER) consists of finding entity mentions from different sources that refer to the same real world entity. In geospatial ER, entities are often represented using different schemes and are subject to incomplete information and inaccurate location, making ER and deduplication daunting tasks. While tremendous advances have been made in traditional entity resolution and natural language processing, geospatial data integration approaches still heavily rely on static similarity measures and human-designed rules. In order to achieve automatic linking of geospatial data, a unified representation of entities with heterogeneous attributes and their geographical context, is needed. To this end, we propose Geo-ER1, a joint framework that combines Transformer-based language models, that have been successfully applied in ER, with a novel learning-based architecture to represent the geospatial character of the entity. Different from existing solutions, Geo-ER does not rely on pre-defined rules and is able to capture information from surrounding entities in order to make context-based, accurate predictions. Extensive experiments on eight real world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, Geo-ER proves to be robust in settings where there is no available training data for a specific city.},

abstract = {In their unrelenting quest for lower latency, cloud providers are deploying servers closer to their customers and enterprises are adopting paid Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) offerings with performance guarantees. Unfortunately, these trends contribute to greater industry consolidation, benefiting larger companies and well-served regions while leaving little room for smaller cloud providers and enterprises to flourish. Instead, we argue that the public Internet could offer good enough performance, if only edge networks could work together to achieve better visibility and control over wide-area routing. We present Tango, a cooperative architecture where pairs of edge networks (e.g., access, enterprise, and data-center networks) collaborate to expose more wide-area paths, collect more accurate measurements, and split traffic more intelligently over the paths. Tango leverages programmable switches at the borders of the edge networks, coupled with techniques to coax BGP into exposing more paths, without requiring support from end hosts or intermediate ASes. Experiments with our preliminary Tango deployment (using IPv6 addresses and the Vultr cloud provider) show that Tango could offer much greater visibility and control over wide-area routing, allowing the public Internet to meet the needs of many modern networked applications.},

In A/B testing, two variants, A and B, are applied in an experimental setting. By measuring the outcome of an evaluation criterion, developers can make evidence-based decisions to guide the evolution of their software. Recent studies highlight the need for enhancing the automation when such experiments are conducted in iterations. To that end, we contribute a novel artifact that aims at enhancing the automation of an experimentation pipeline of a micro-service system relying on the principles of self-adaptation. Concretely, we propose SEAByTE, an experimental framework for testing novel self-adaptation solutions to enhance the automation of continuous A/B testing of a micro-service based system. We illustrate the use of the SEAByTE artifact with a concrete example.},

This ultimately impacted the driver well being. This work provides a foundation for measuring the Parking Wellbeing Index as a tailored refocus of the sustainability society index that takes into account the car parking experience. The framework makes use of the Occupancy rate of the parking site and traffic flow in the vicinity of the parking site, as well as the environmental aspect, which includes both the business/economical dimension and the Green (nature) dimension. We demonstrated how the developed index could be applied in Oulu City center, where a set of experiments have been conducted and tested. Especially, software architecture has been devised to automatically retrieve traffic and parking occupancy using the City of Oulu open data platform. While land use classification has been used to assess the Green and Business aspects of the parking area. The results could help the municipality better manage the buildings and the landscape in a way to maximize community wellbeing.},

abstract = {Advances in personalization of digital services are driven by low-cost data collection and processing, in addition to the wide variety of third-party frameworks for authentication, storage, and marketing. New privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act, increasingly require organizations to explicitly state their data practices in privacy policies. When data practices change, a new version of the policy is released. This can occur a few times a year, when data collection or processing requirements are rapidly changing. Consent evolution raises specific challenges to ensuring GDPR compliance. We propose a formal consent framework to support organizations, data users, and data subjects in their understanding of policy evolution under a consent regime that supports both the retroactive and non-retroactive granting and withdrawal of consent. The contributions include (i) a formal framework to reason about data collection and access under multiple consent granting and revocation scenarios, (ii) a scripting language that implements the consent framework for encoding and executing different scenarios, (iii) five consent evolution use cases that illustrate how organizations would evolve their policies using this framework, and (iv) a scalability evaluation of the reasoning framework. The framework models are used to verify when user consent prevents or detects unauthorized data collection and access. The framework can be integrated into a runtime architecture to monitor policy violations as data practices evolve in real time. The framework was evaluated using the five use cases and a simulation to measure the framework scalability. The simulation results show that the approach is computationally scalable for use in runtime consent monitoring under a standard model of data collection and access and practice and policy evolution.},

However, it is often impossible to have access to all the delay measurements within a network. This can be due to network failures or to established measurement policies. For these reasons, delay matrix completion techniques are important for an optimal network monitoring service. In this paper, we formulate the completion problem as a neural collaborative filtering problem by testing two different architectures, generalized matrix factorization and multi-layer perceptron. We evaluate these methods on two different datasets: a synthetic one generated by an autonomous system simulator, and a real-world dataset from Ripe Atlas platform. Finally, a comparative study is conducted between these neural collaborative filtering methods and standard approaches.},

abstract = {With the emergence of services that require a high level of data usage, wireless networks are required to support higher data rates and greater capacity. To satisfy these requests, 5G architecture supports a high-frequency band. However, a high frequency occurs small range resulting in a need for numerous base stations (BSs). Deploying numerous BSs can be considered practically impossible due to high costs. To address the cost issue, instead of BSs, access points (APs) are used in Cell-free networks. That is, Cell-free networks that offer promising coverage gain and enhanced data rates consist of multiple APs and a single central process unit (CPU). This coverage of multiple APs' is much smaller than BS's. As a result, this small coverage can lead to frequent handovers. To overcome this frequent handover, an optimized handover scheme for the Cell-free network is required. Despite this optimization requirement, many studies in the Cell-free network field remain at the physical layer stage. No basic handover process is optimized for Cell-free networks, and no protocol for upper layers is defined. We consider that existing technologies will continue to be used in Cell-free networks, even if the protocols optimized for Cellfree networks are developed and used. For these reasons, we construct a Cell-free network architecture similar to the 5G structure for the handover process. In this paper, we investigate the handover process in 5G architecture and extend it to a Cellfree network environment. In our simulations, APs initiate and perform the handover process based on measurement reports from users. We analyzed and discussed the performance matrices of the handover in a Cell-free network environment, such as handover delay and throughput.},

abstract = {Detecting the arbitrarily oriented text in natural images is a challenging task in multimedia due to variations in text curvatures, orientations, and aspect ratios of natural scenes. Most previous scene text detectors often fail to locate the text instances which have a peculiar shape (an extreme aspect ratio) precisely. In this paper, we propose a dynamic end-to-end framework (DEF) which includes a convolution-based dynamic encoder (CDE) with various attention types to generate a deformable and dynamic view for multi-oriented text instances and curve ones. Different from previous methods that apply time-consuming post-processing steps like NMS, our method uses a Transformer-based decoder (TD) with a bipartite matching loss to model the relationship of corresponding queries and ground truths. As a result, by leveraging such a well-designed architecture, the receptive field will not be limited to a fixed shape, and a combination of global attention and local features provides a better representation for texts in natural scenes. We conduct extensive experiments qualitatively and quantitatively on several popular datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared with several state-of-the-art scene text detectors.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, there has been an increase in the use of chatbots for educational purposes. Nevertheless, the chatbot technologies and architectures that are often applied to educational contexts are not necessarily designed for such contexts. While general-purpose chatbot technologies can be used in educational contexts, there are some challenges specific to these contexts that need to be taken into consideration. Namely, chatbot technologies intended for education should, by design, integrate directly within online learning applications and focus on achieving learning goals by supporting learners with the task at hand. In this paper, we propose a blueprint for an architecture specifically aimed at integrating task-oriented chatbots to support learners in educational contexts. We then present a proof-of-concept implementation of our blueprint as a part of a code review application designed to teach programming best practices. Our blueprint could serve as a starting point for developers in education looking to build chatbot technologies targeting educational contexts and is a first step toward an open chatbot architecture explicitly tailored for learning applications.},

abstract = {Android emulators today are not only acting as a debugging tool for developers but also serving the massive end-users. These end-user Android emulators have attracted millions of users due to their advantages of running mobile apps on desktops and are especially appealing for mobile game players who demand larger screens and better performance. Besides, they commonly provide some customized assistant functionalities to improve the user experience, such as keyboard mapping and app installation from the host. To implement these services, emulators inevitably introduce communication channels between host OS and Android OS (in the Virtual Machine), thus forming a unique architecture which mobile phone does not have. However, it is unknown whether this architecture brings any new security risks to emulators.This paper performed a systematic study on end-user Android emulators and discovered a series of security flaws on communication channel authentication, permission control, and open interfaces. Attackers could exploit these flaws to bypass Android security mechanisms and escalate their privileges inside emulators, ultimately invading users' privacy, such as stealing valuable game accounts and credentials. To understand the impact of our findings, we studied six popular emulators and measured their flaws. The results showed that the issues are pervasive and could cause severe security consequences. We believe our work just shows the tip of the iceberg, and further research can be done to improve the security of this ecosystem.},

However, Cybersecurity Officers (CSO) would rather receive a single alert summarizing the entire incident. Triggering a single alert per attack is a challenge that requires developing and evaluating advanced event correlation techniques and models to determine the relationships between the different observed events/alerts. In this work, we propose a flexible architecture oriented toward the correlation and aggregation of events and alerts in a multilevel iterative approach. In our scheme, sensors generate events and alerts that are stored in a non-relational database queried by modules that create knowledge structured as meta-alerts that are also stored in the database. These meta-alerts (also called hyperalerts) are, in turn, used iteratively to create new knowledge. This iterative approach can be used to aggregate information at multiple levels or steps in complex attack models. Our architecture also allows the incorporation of additional sensors and the evaluation of various correlation techniques and multistage attack models. The capabilities of the system are assessed through three case studies.},

abstract = {Multi-tenant computing platforms are typically comprised of several software and hardware components including platform firmware, operating system, virtualization monitor, and tenant workloads (typically in a virtual machine, container, or application). This model is well established in large scale commercial deployments, but the downside is that all platform components and operators are in the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) of the tenant. This aspect is ill-suited for privacy-oriented workloads that aim to minimize the TCB. Confidential computing [1] presents a good stepping-stone towards providing a quantifiable TCB for computing. Confidential computing requires the use of a HW-attested Trusted Execution Environment for data-in-use protection. The RISC-V architecture presents a strong foundation for meeting the requirements for Confidential Computing in a clean slate manner. This paper describes a reference architecture and discusses ISA, non-ISA and System-on-Chip (SoC) requirements for confidential computing on RISC-V Platforms. It discusses proposed RISC-V ISA and non-ISA for Confidential Virtual-machine Extension, referred to as CoVE.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, the high-end CPU market is undergoing a transformational change. Moving away from using x86 as the sole architecture for high performance devices, we have witnessed the introduction of heavy-weight Arm CPUs computing devices. Among these, perhaps the most influential was the introduction of Apple's M-series architecture, aimed at completely replacing Intel CPUs in the Apple ecosystem. However, while significant effort has been invested analyzing x86 CPUs, the Apple ecosystem remains largely unexplored.In this paper, we set out to investigate the resilience of the Apple ecosystem to speculative side-channel attacks. We first establish the basic toolkit needed for mounting side-channel attacks, such as the structure of caches and CPU speculation depth. We then tackle Apple's degradation of the timer resolution in both native and browser-based code. Remarkably, we show that distinguishing cache misses from cache hits can be done without time measurements, replacing timing based primitives with timerless counterparts based on race conditions. Finally, we use our distinguishing primitive to construct eviction sets and mount Spectre attacks, all while avoiding the use of timers.We then evaluate Safari's side-channel resilience. We bypass the compressed 35-bit addressing and the value poisoning countermeasures, creating a primitive that can speculatively read and leak any 64-bit address within Safari's rendering process. Combining this with a new method for consolidating websites from different domains into the same renderer process, we demonstrate end-to-end attacks leaking sensitive information, such as passwords, inbox content, and locations from popular services such as Google.},

abstract = {CT has been the central rallying point for K-12 computing education at least since the early 2010s. Many teachers, school administrators, and policymakers have joined the movement. A consensus has emerged over the conceptual landscape of CT. Meanwhile, machine learning (ML) has triggered some major changes in many sectors of computing. Children’s lives today are full of ML-driven services—take TikTok’s spot-on recommendations, social media’s automatic tagging of their friends in photos, and targeted personalized advertisement, just to mention a few. Children cannot learn to think about and design ML technology from learning classical programming. ML is poised to upend the CT consensus. Look at some of the changes ML has already triggered in computing. It has enabled greatly improved speech and image recognition, powerful recommendations on streaming services, autonomous navigation of cars, super-human performance in board and computer games, and even alternative-reality “deepfake” videos. Most advances in topics above are due to hardware evolution to non-traditional, special purpose architectures, new algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) or generative adversarial networks (GAN), and new objectives and measures of success. We will show that several key CT concepts, including debugging, problem-solving workflow, correctness, and notional machines, are insufficient for ML and need to be extended. Moreover, ML introduces new concepts including neural networks, curating and training data, and reinforcement learning that are not part of CT at all. All these changes challenge the traditional views related to teaching CT in K–12. ML is not the only emerging technology appearing in the computing landscape. Quantum computing and biological computing are not far behind. We need to start rethinking how CT must evolve to anticipate and meet these challenges.},

abstract = {Out-of-core random walk system has recently attracted a lot of attention as an economical way to run billions of walkers over large graphs. However, existing out-of-core random walk systems are all built upon general out-of-core graph processing frameworks, and hence do not take advantage of the unique properties of random walk applications. Different from traditional graph analysis algorithms, the sampling process of random walk can be decoupled from the processing of the walkers. It enables the system to reserve only pre-sample results in memory, which are typically much smaller than the entire edge set. Moreover, in random walk, it is not the number of walkers but the number of steps moved per second that dominates the overall performance. Thus, with independent walkers, there is no need to process all the walkers simultaneously. In this paper, we present NosWalker, an out-of-core random walk system that replaces the graph oriented scheduling with a decoupled system architecture that provides walker oriented scheduling. NosWalker is able to adaptively generate walkers and flexibly adjust the distribution of reserved pre-sample results in memory. Instead of processing all the walkers at once, NosWalker only tries its best to keep a few walkers able to continuously move forward. Experimental results show that NosWalker can achieve up to two orders of magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art out-of-core random walk systems. In particular, NosWalker demonstrates superior performance when the memory capacity can only hold about 10\%-50\% of the graph data, which can be a common case when the user needs to run billions of walkers over large graphs.},

abstract = {This workshop discusses, presents, and demos examples of how advances in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) and in Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) will benefit Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). CAV technologies provide an enormous opportunity to generate and collect traffic datasets that directly impact Highway Traffic Management Operations (HTOps). CAV provides novel datasets in terms of types and pervasiveness of coverage of highway networks at a scale that we have not been exposed to before. This enables current HTOps for extensions in features and enhancements in accuracies. HTOps, as defined by Canadian ITS architecture [1], aims at managing traffic to enhance the efficiency of highways, avoid congestion, increase the safety of travelers, and enable more sustainable transportation. This workshop focuses on answering the following question “What (and How) are the features of CAV-generated data that can leverage (HTOps)?” We compare CAV-generated data to traditional traffic data (those collected from relatively “fixed location” sources such as CCTV, electronic loop detectors) and those collected from probe floating vehicles.Extensive research has been conducted into creating self-driving cars that can drive and maneuver on roads in a safe manner. This is embodied in the development of advanced safety features that include blind spot information, reversing/ parking/ lane change assistance, collision warning, and more. CAV can make movement actions based on knowledge of surroundings which relies on hundreds of thousands of data points collected from embedded sensors (LiDAR, cameras, radars, OBD unit, an IMU), (estimated at) a few Terabytes/Vehicle/Day. For example, Volvo’s Cirrus [2] and Lyft Level 5 [3] open-sourced datasets make use of high-resolution video cameras as well as LiDAR sensors to produce Gaussian points that monitor vehicle 3600 surroundings.As an example HTOPS service, we discuss in detail Variable Speed Limits (VSL) and how CAV data can be used to optimize maximum travel speed limit in a dynamic manner over different highway zones based on traffic, congestion, and weather. VSL helps achieve the objectives of HTOps, including devising premeditated plans for peak hours operations and controlling the travel speed in order to increase the throughput of vehicles. To increase safety and ensure compliance, gradual implementation through increments/ decrements of speed along highway zones is required. The extent, expressiveness and quality of CAV data can help achieve such advanced HTOps. For example, the nuScenes dataset [4] that uses linked data to break down and simplify data schema (with various objects such as Category, Ego Pose, Instance, Lidarseg, Map, Sample_annotation, and Sample Data.) With the help of distance measurements, space headings can be accurately defined for vehicles in front and behind the main car. In addition, current vehicle speed data can be obtained from onboard in real-time. This can also be extended to other HTOps services such as Dynamic Lane Management (DLM) which sets lane allocation rules based on the given traffic state, assigning a lane(s) to a prioritized class of vehicle or assigning variable travel speeds for each lane.CAV manufacturers and researchers have made significant progress in building a CAV technology stack that allows a vehicle to drive itself in a safe manner. The technology stack consists of sensing (described above), perception, prediction, and planning layers. The higher three layers use sophisticated deep learning machine learning to process collected data and produce further information on highway traffic conditions. For example, with camera footage, object (e.g. pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs) detection software can be applied to identify, categorize and characterize surrounding objects. At the same time, LiDAR data can be mapped to provide a bird’s eye spatial view of the surrounding area. Such semantic object maps with binding boxes on objects and trajectory lines are valuable data that TMCs can use to understand the current roadway environment. This is important for understanding stopping time, and congestion levels between cars on the highway provided the current lane of the vehicle. However, due to how recent such developments are, the focus has been on developing the sensing and perception layers of that stack, with much less focus given to the prediction and planning layers.},

abstract = {Semantically connecting users and items is a fundamental problem for the matching stage of an industrial recommender system. Recent advances in this topic are based on multi-channel retrieval to efficiently measure users' interest on items from the massive candidate pool. However, existing studies are primarily built upon pre-defined retrieval channels, including User-CF (U2U), Item-CF (I2I), and Embedding-based Retrieval (U2I), thus access to the limited correlation between users and items which solely entail from partial information of latent interactions. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic integrated cross-channel (MIC) approach for the large-scale recommendation, which maximally leverages the inherent multi-channel mutual information to enhance the matching performance. Specifically, MIC robustly models correlation within user-item, user-user, and item-item from latent interactions in a universal schema. For each channel, MIC naturally aligns pairs with semantic similarity and distinguishes them otherwise with more uniform anisotropic representation space. While state-of-the-art methods require specific architectural design, MIC intuitively considers them as a whole by enabling the complete information flow among users and items. Thus MIC can be easily plugged into other retrieval recommender systems. Extensive experiments show that our MIC helps several state-of-the-art models boost their performance on four real-world benchmarks. The satisfactory deployment of the proposed MIC on industrial online services empirically proves its scalability and flexibility.},

abstract = {Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) has been evolved to enable different video streaming services to deliver media content over the Internet with less latency and improved quality. However, using only a single CDN is highly vulnerable to outages and crashes, resulting in a poor viewer experience. Regardless of viewers, traffic, or media content, a single CDN will be never sufficient to satisfy viewers' quality of experience (QoE) requirements. To avoid single CDN issues, leveraging multiple CDNs from multiple providers, refers to multi-CDN, helps in improving performance, increasing geographic coverage, and alleviating outages. An essential part in multi-CDN solutions is the decision to select the best performing CDN in real-time, depending on periodic measurements of CDNs and video players. While multi-CDN architecture provides tremendous benefits, it has not been well investigated and integrated with the industry. This paper highlights various decision strategies for real-time CDN selection that helps content providers select the right solution aligned with their goals and business.},

abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained growing interest in miscellaneous applications owing to their outstanding ability in extracting latent representation on graph structures. To render GNN-based service for IoT-driven smart applications, the traditional model serving paradigm resorts to the cloud by fully uploading the geo-distributed input data to the remote datacenter. However, our empirical measurements reveal the significant communication overhead of such cloud-based serving and highlight the profound potential in applying the emerging fog computing. To maximize the architectural benefits brought by fog computing, in this paper, we present Fograph, a novel distributed real-time GNN inference framework that leverages diverse resources of multiple fog nodes in proximity to IoT data sources. By introducing heterogeneity-aware execution planning and GNN-specific compression techniques, Fograph tailors its design to well accommodate the unique characteristics of GNN serving in fog environment. Prototype-based evaluation and case study demonstrate that Fograph significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art cloud serving and vanilla fog deployment by up to 5.39 \texttimes{} execution speedup and 6.84 \texttimes{} throughput improvement.},

abstract = {Human detection in the wild is a research topic of paramount importance in computer vision, and it is the starting step for designing intelligent systems oriented to human interaction that work in complete autonomy. To achieve this goal, computer vision and machine learning should aim at superhuman capabilities. In this work, we address the problem of fine-grained human analysis under occlusions and perspective constraints. More specifically, we discuss some issues and some possible solutions to effectively detect people using pose estimation methods and to detect humans under occlusions both in the two-dimensional (2D) image plane and in the 3D space exploiting single monocular cameras. Dealing with occlusion can be done at the joint level or pixel level: We discuss two different solutions, the former based on a supervised neural network architecture for detecting occluded joints and the latter based on a semi-supervised specialized GAN that exploits both appearance and human shape attributes to determine the missing parts of the visible shape. To deal with perspective constraints, we further discuss a neural approach based on a double architecture that learns to create an optimal neural representation, which is useful to reconstruct the 3D position of human keypoints starting with simple RGB images. All these approaches have a critical point in common: the need for large annotated datasets. To have large, fair, consistent, transparent, and ethical datasets, we propose the adoption of synthetic datasets as, for example, JTA and MOTSynth. In this article, we discuss the pros and cons of using synthetic datasets while tackling several human-centered AI issues with respect to European GDPR rules for privacy. We further explore and discuss an application in the field of risk assessment by space occupancy estimation during the COVID-19 pandemic called Inter-Homines.},

abstract = {IP hijack attacks deflect traffic between endpoints through the attacker network, leading to man-in-the-middle attacks. Current detection solutions are only based on AS-level path analysis, while attacks that include data-plane manipulations may exhibit only geographic anomalies and preserve the AS-level route, or hide the problematic AS in the path. Thus, there is a need to develop data-plane analysis frameworks that examine the actual route packets traverse. We introduce here a deep learning system that examines the geography of traceroute measurements to detect malicious routes. We use multiple geolocation services, with various levels of confidence; each also suffers from location errors. Moreover, identifying a hijacked route is not sufficient since an operator presented with a hijack alert needs an indication of the cause for flagging out the problematic route. Thus, we introduce a novel deep learning layer, called Source-Aware Self-Attention (&lt;italic&gt;SASA&lt;/italic&gt;), which is an extension of the attention mechanism. &lt;italic&gt;SASA&lt;/italic&gt; learns each data source’s confidence and combines this score with the attention of each router in the route to point out the most problematic one. We validate our IP hijacking classification method using two router data types: coordinates and country location, and show that &lt;italic&gt;SASA&lt;/italic&gt; outperforms the regular self-attention layer, using the same neural network architecture, and achieves extremely high accuracy.},

abstract = {The well-being of villages and villagers is directly related to the development of urban-rural relations. Rural development is an important part of poverty alleviation, as well as the main goal and means of rural rejuvenation, Because rural planning affects rural economic development and rural revitalization. Electronic imaging can improve the speed of rural area planning, and can also model the planned scheme. However, the current rural planning still lacks top-level design, which cannot improve the overall structural design of rural planning, and the data resources of rural planning are not perfect. Therefore, this paper studied the direction of rural planning and design by analyzing the focus, problems and external environment characteristics of rural planning, and then analyzed the application characteristics in rural planning according to the process of 3D image technology. By reducing the complex design links in rural planning, the office efficiency of planning and the 3D visualization of planning model can be promoted, so as to improve the effect of rural planning and the construction service of rural planning. The simulated annealing algorithm showed that the planning efficiency and average planning speed of 3D image application in rural planning were gradually increasing; the average planning efficiency was about 1.80, and the average planning speed was about 1.05. The planning efficiency increased by 1.20 in the whole process, while the average planning speed increased by 0.33 in the whole process. Through comparison, it can be seen that the planning rationality of rural planning under 3D image was 12.16\% higher than the original one, while the measurement error rate of some teachers was 47.28\% lower. In a word, 3D imaging and electronic imaging can improve the architectural design and layout planning of rural planning.},

Influenced by the steady growth of computing power of the devices, the paradigm of IoT-based service deployment is expected to change, following the example of cloud-based infrastructure: An embedded platform can be provided as-a-service to several independent application service suppliers. This fosters additional challenges concerning security and isolation.

In this paper, we define new trusted computing concepts, focusing on privilege separation among several entities sharing one physical device. The concepts guarantee remote recovery capabilities within a bounded amount of time, even if notable portions of the software stack have been compromised. We derive a resilient system architecture suitable for the secure operation of multiple isolated services on one embedded device. We integrate an interface for detecting intrusions and anomalies to enable the automatic recovery of compromised devices and prototype our system on a Nitrogen8M development board. Our evaluation shows that the overhead in terms of network throughput and CPU performance is low so that we believe that our concept is a meaningful step towards more resilient future IoT devices.},

abstract = {The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has brought the mental health of people under risk. Social counselling has gained remarkable significance in this environment. Unlike general goal-oriented dialogues, a conversation between a patient and a therapist is considerably implicit, though the objective of the conversation is quite apparent. In such a case, understanding the intent of the patient is imperative in providing effective counselling in therapy sessions, and the same applies to a dialogue system as well. In this work, we take forward a small but an important step in the development of an automated dialogue system for mental-health counselling. We develop a novel dataset, named HOPE, to provide a platform for the dialogue-act classification in counselling conversations. We identify the requirement of such conversation and propose twelve domain-specific dialogue-act (DAC) labels. We collect ~ 12.9K utterances from publicly-available counselling session videos on YouTube, extract their transcripts, clean, and annotate them with DAC labels. Further, we propose SPARTA, a transformer-based architecture with a novel speaker- and time-aware contextual learning for the dialogue-act classification. Our evaluation shows convincing performance over several baselines, achieving state-of-the-art on HOPE. We also supplement our experiments with extensive empirical and qualitative analyses of SPARTA.},

However, additional requirements to data delivery emerge, concerning path-awareness and Quality of Service. New internet architectures and their services enable path-aware routing and guaranteed bandwidth. Those features do not only enable the creation of new services but also enable the potential of trading resources such as bandwidth. We design a market mechanism that determines the bandwidth allocation and prices for buyers who express their service requirements in terms of limit orders. Our design builds a price-quantity allocation around a Fisher-market with Leontief utility functions, addressing directly the allocation of bandwidth along one route and allowing for partial filling of orders in the case of congestion using price-priority.},

An important part of this architecture is the implementation of 5G network functions statelessly. However, statelessness and its associated serialization and de-serialization of data and database interaction significantly increase latency. In this work, we take the first steps towards quantifying the cost of statelessness in a cloud-native 5G system. We compare the cost of different state management paradigms, and propose a number of optimizations to reduce this cost. Our preliminary results indicate that sharing user state among 5G functions reduces the overall cost by on an average of 10\% in experiments with 100 to 1000 simultaneous requests. Optimizations such as non-blocking calls and custom database APIs also reduce cost, albeit to a lower extent. We believe that the paradigms proposed in this paper can aid operators and software vendors as they design cloud-native 5G networks.},

In this work, we propose a robust, universal and non-invasive Mirai-based malware detection engine employing a compact deep neural network architecture. Our design allows programmatic collection of CPU power footprints with integrated current sensors under various device states, such as idle, service and attack. A lightweight online inference model is deployed in the CPU for on-the-fly classification. Our model is robust against noisy environment with a lucid design of noise reduction function. This work appears to be the first step towards a viable CPU malware detection engine based on power fingerprinting. The extensive simulation study under ARM architecture that is widely used in IoT devices, demonstrates a high detection accuracy of 99.1\% at a speed less than 1ms. By analyzing Mirai-based infection under distinguishable phases for power feature extraction, our model has further demonstrated an accuracy of 96.3\% on model-unknown variants detection.},

abstract = {Serverless is a popular choice for cloud service architects because it can provide scalability and load-based billing with minimal developer effort. Functions-as-a-service (FaaS) are originally stateless, but emerging frameworks add stateful abstractions. For instance, the widely used Durable Functions (DF) allow developers to write advanced serverless applications, including reliable workflows and actors, in a programming language of choice. DF implicitly and continuosly persists the state and progress of applications, which greatly simplifies development, but can create an IOps bottleneck.To improve efficiency, we introduce Netherite, a novel architecture for executing serverless workflows on an elastic cluster. Netherite groups the numerous application objects into a smaller number of partitions, and pipelines the state persistence of each partition. This improves latency and throughput, as it enables workflow steps to group commit, even if causally dependent. Moreover, Netherite leverages FASTER's hybrid log approach to support larger-than-memory application state, and to enable efficient partition movement between compute hosts.Our evaluation shows that (a) Netherite achieves lower latency and higher throughput than the original DF engine, by more than an order of magnitude in some cases, and (b) that Netherite has lower latency than some commonly used alternatives, like AWS Step Functions or cloud storage triggers.},

abstract = {This article introduces the first open-source FPGA-based infrastructure, MetaSys, with a prototype in a RISC-V system, to enable the rapid implementation and evaluation of a wide range of cross-layer techniques in real hardware. Hardware-software cooperative techniques are powerful approaches to improving the performance, quality of service, and security of general-purpose processors. They are, however, typically challenging to rapidly implement and evaluate in real hardware as they require full-stack changes to the hardware, system software, and instruction-set architecture (ISA).MetaSys implements a rich hardware-software interface and lightweight metadata support that can be used as a common basis to rapidly implement and evaluate new cross-layer techniques. We demonstrate MetaSys’s versatility and ease-of-use by implementing and evaluating three cross-layer techniques for: (i) prefetching in graph analytics; (ii) bounds checking in memory unsafe languages, and (iii) return address protection in stack frames; each technique requiring only ~100 lines of Chisel code over MetaSys.Using MetaSys, we perform the first detailed experimental study to quantify the performance overheads of using a single metadata management system to enable multiple cross-layer optimizations in CPUs. We identify the key sources of bottlenecks and system inefficiency of a general metadata management system. We design MetaSys to minimize these inefficiencies and provide increased versatility compared to previously proposed metadata systems. Using three use cases and a detailed characterization, we demonstrate that a common metadata management system can be used to efficiently support diverse cross-layer techniques in CPUs.

abstract = {Eyebrows play a critical role in facial expression and appearance. Although the 3D digitization of faces is well explored, less attention has been drawn to 3D eyebrow modeling. In this work, we propose EMS, the first learning-based framework for single-view 3D eyebrow reconstruction. Following the methods of scalp hair reconstruction, we also represent the eyebrow as a set of fiber curves and convert the reconstruction to fibers growing problem. Three modules are then carefully designed: RootFinder firstly localizes the fiber root positions which indicate where to grow; OriPredictor predicts an orientation field in the 3D space to guide the growing of fibers; FiberEnder is designed to determine when to stop the growth of each fiber. Our OriPredictor directly borrows the method used in hair reconstruction. Considering the differences between hair and eyebrows, both RootFinder and FiberEnder are newly proposed. Specifically, to cope with the challenge that the root location is severely occluded, we formulate root localization as a density map estimation task. Given the predicted density map, a density-based clustering method is further used for finding the roots. For each fiber, the growth starts from the root point and moves step by step until the ending, where each step is defined as an oriented line segment with a constant length according to the predicted orientation field. To determine when to end, a pixel-aligned RNN architecture is designed to form a binary classifier, which outputs stop or not for each growing step. To support the training of all proposed networks, we build the first 3D synthetic eyebrow dataset that contains 400 high-quality eyebrow models manually created by artists. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed EMS pipeline on a variety of different eyebrow styles and lengths, ranging from short and sparse to long bushy eyebrows.},

abstract = {Design Patterns detection in Object-Oriented software systems is essential for effectively supporting program comprehension and re-engineering tasks. It helps to recover, from source code, the developers' design decisions and trade-offs that could be not up-to-date or even not documented. Several approaches to mine design patterns from source code have been defined in the last twelve years and they are all based on the analysis of object-oriented systems components, their relationships, and behaviors to identify the roles played in the patterns. Both static and dynamic approaches need to perform matching between data captured from the system with the design patterns specification that encodes the structure and the behavior of the micro-architectural solution. The matching process, in principle, can be formulated as a sub-graph matching problem that is NP-complete. This problem has been addressed in the literature using heuristics designed to produce good solutions in an acceptable time, but the task is still expensive with a significant trade-off between accuracy and performance. This work proposes the adoption of a neural-based approach that exploits graph neural networks to perform detection using a more efficient sub-graph matching step outperforming existing heuristics proposed for this task. The pattern detection approach has been assessed on several open-source systems widely used to perform design pattern detection obtaining very good results for both detection performances and efficiency.},

abstract = {Travel-time prediction constitutes a task of high importance in transportation networks, with web mapping services like Google Maps regularly serving vast quantities of travel time queries from users and enterprises alike. Further, such a task requires accounting for complex spatiotemporal interactions (modelling both the topological properties of the road network and anticipating events---such as rush hours---that may occur in the future). Hence, it is an ideal target for graph representation learning at scale. Here we present a graph neural network estimator for estimated time of arrival (ETA) which we have deployed in production at Google Maps. While our main architecture consists of standard GNN building blocks, we further detail the usage of training schedule methods such as MetaGradients in order to make our model robust and production-ready. We also provide prescriptive studies: ablating on various architectural decisions and training regimes, and qualitative analyses on real-world situations where our model provides a competitive edge. Our GNN proved powerful when deployed, significantly reducing negative ETA outcomes in several regions compared to the previous production baseline (40+\% in cities like Sydney).},

abstract = {In online recommendation, financial service, etc., the most common application of multi-task learning (MTL) is the multi-step conversion estimations. A core property of the multi-step conversion is the sequential dependence among tasks. However, most existing works focus far more on the specific post-view click-through rate (CTR) and post-click conversion rate (CVR) estimations, which neglect the generalization of sequential dependence multi-task learning (SDMTL). Additionally, the performance of the SDMTL framework is also deteriorated by the interference derived from implicitly conflict information passing between adjacent tasks. In this paper, a systematic learning paradigm of the SDMTL problem is established for the first time, which can transform the SDMTL problem into a general MTL problem with constraints and be applicable to more general multi-step conversion scenarios with stronger task dependence. Also, the distribution dependence relationship between adjacent task spaces is illustrated from a theoretical point of view. On the other hand, an SDMTL architecture, named Task Aware Feature Extraction (TAFE), is developed to enable dynamic task representation learning from a sample-wise view. TAFE selectively reconstructs the implicit shared information corresponding to each sample case and performs explicit task-specific extraction under dependence constraints. Extensive experiments on offline public and real-world industrial datasets, and online A/B implementations demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of proposed theoretical and implementation frameworks.},

abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a core technology to provide learning models to perform complex tasks. Boosted by Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS), the number of applications relying on ML capabilities is ever increasing. However, ML models are the source of different privacy violations through passive or active attacks from different entities. In this paper, we present MixNN a proxy-based privacy-preserving system for federated learning to protect the privacy of participants against a curious or malicious aggregation server trying to infer sensitive information (i.e., membership and attribute inferences). MixNN receives the model updates from participants and mixes layers between participants before sending the mixed updates to the aggregation server. This mixing strategy drastically reduces privacy leaks without any trade-off with utility. Indeed, mixing the updates of the model has no impact on the result of the aggregation of the updates computed by the server. We report on an extensive evaluation of MixNN using several datasets and neural networks architectures to quantify privacy leakage through membership and attribute inference attacks as well the robustness of the protection. We show that MixNN significantly limits both the membership and attribute inferences compared to a baseline using model compression and noisy gradient (well known to damage the utility) while keeping the same level of utility as classic federated learning.},

abstract = {Adversarial attacks against commercial black-box speech platforms, including cloud speech APIs and voice control devices, have received little attention until recent years. Constructing such attacks is difficult mainly due to the unique characteristics of time-domain speech signals and the much more complex architecture of acoustic systems. The current "black-box" attacks all heavily rely on the knowledge of prediction/confidence scores or other probability information to craft effective adversarial examples (AEs), which can be intuitively defended by service providers without returning these messages. In this paper, we take one more step forward and propose two novel adversarial attacks in more practical and rigorous scenarios. For commercial cloud speech APIs, we propose Occam, a decision-only black-box adversarial attack, where only final decisions are available to the adversary. In Occam, we formulate the decision-only AE generation as a discontinuous large-scale global optimization problem, and solve it by adaptively decomposing this complicated problem into a set of sub-problems and cooperatively optimizing each one. Our Occam is a one-size-fits-all approach, which achieves 100\% success rates of attacks (SRoA) with an average SNR of 14.23dB, on a wide range of popular speech and speaker recognition APIs, including Google, Alibaba, Microsoft, Tencent, iFlytek, and Jingdong, outperforming the state-of-the-art black-box attacks. For commercial voice control devices, we propose NI-Occam, the first non-interactive physical adversarial attack, where the adversary does not need to query the oracle and has no access to its internal information and training data. We, for the first time, combine adversarial attacks with model inversion attacks, and thus generate the physically-effective audio AEs with high transferability without any interaction with target devices. Our experimental results show that NI-Occam can successfully fool Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, Google Assistant, iFlytek and Amazon Echo with an average SRoA of 52\% and SNR of 9.65dB, shedding light on non-interactive physical attacks against voice control devices.},

The x265 encoder [2]-[4] is a popular open-source encoder, which generates bitstreams compliant with the H.265/MPEG-HEVC video coding standard [5]. Built on top of x264[6], the x265 encoder is integrated into several popular open-source frameworks, such as ffmpeg [7], GStreamer [8], and Handbrake [9]. In addition, the x265 is used by a variety of broadcast and streaming service providers who leverage the benefits of HEVC for streaming live and over-the-top (OTT) content. In addition to implementing nearly all the tools defined in HEVC, it implements many algorithmic optimizations that enable trading off encoder performance for quality [2]-[4]. The performance-critical kernels are implemented with hand-coded assembly kernels that use AVX2 and AVX-512 single instruction, multiple data instructions to improve performance on x86 CPUs. This flexible architecture of x265 makes it a popular choice for HEVC encoding for both on-premises and cloud services.Recent x265 development efforts have been focused on further improving the coding gains. Specifically, the motion compensated spatio-temporal filtering (MCSTF) employed within the coding loop is especially useful for pictures that contain a high level of noise. It utilizes previously generated motion vectors across different video content resolutions to find the best temporal correspondence for low-pass filtering, while the temporal filtering is applied to the I- and P-frames. Figure 1 schematically illustrates the motion estimation process for temporal filtering in a temporal window, which consists of 5 adjacent pictures: two past, two future and one central picture used for producing a single filtered picture. Motion estimation is applied between the central picture and each future or past picture, thereby generating multiple motion-compensated predictions, which are then combined by using adaptive filtering to produce a final noise-reduced picture. Thus, a hierarchical motion estimation scheme is employed (layers L0, L1 and L2, are illustrated in Figure 2). Subsampled pictures are generated for all reference picturesand the original picture as well: i.e., L1, while L2 is derived from L1 by using the same subsampling method. First, the motion estimation is done for each 16x16 block in L2. Then, the selected motion vector is used as an initial value for estimating the motion in L1. After that, the same is performed for estimating the motion in L0.As a final step, the subpixel motion is estimated for each 8x8 block by using an interpolation filter on L0. Particularly, the motion of reference pictures before and after, relative to the original picture, is estimated per the 8x8 picture block. In turn, the motion compensation is applied on the pictures before and after the original picture according to the best matching motion for each block. i.e., such that pixel coordinates of the original picture in each block have the best matching coordinates within the referenced pictures. The filter is then applied to the current pixels, and after that, the filtered picture is encoded. Note that the pixels are processed one by one for the luma and chroma channels. The new sample value, is calculated by using the following equation:[EQUATION]where Io is the original pixel, Ir(i) is the intensity of the corresponding pixel within the motion compensated picture i, and wr(i, a) is the weight of the motion compensated picture where a is the number of available motion compensated pictures. The conducted extensive experimental results show significant bit-rate savings in terms of BD-BR [10].},

abstract = {Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networks (SDN) do not leave any legacy network services untouched. This work will present how Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) can evolve to the cloud. Our approach is to introduce this evolution within a step-by-step architecture guideline while keeping standards compatibility. We also show how PMIPv6 can fit into a central cloud - edge cloud environment on the top of Kubernetes and Openstack under a unified orchestration umbrella. The proper integration of PMIPv6 into this new environment does not just enforce acquiring new capabilities, e.g., scaling PMIPv6 elements; it also can ensure closed-loop orchestration where PMIPv6 can be controlled continuously by the actual network needs.},

abstract = {SPIRE is an open-source project that enables the provisioning of verifiable identities to software components based on an attestation of the software properties, avoiding the leakage risks of pre-provisioned secrets. This paper presents an implementation of a SPIRE plugin that enables the attestation of AMD SEV-SNP confidential virtual machines. Our approach leverages the pluggable architecture from SPIRE and depends only on minor changes to QEMU, changes taken from its open-source community, and that should soon be merged. As a result, application providers can now use SPIRE to restrict sensitive credentials to be available only to services in environments protected from malicious hosts and cloud operators using AMD SEV-SNP technology. Our experiments show that the steps needed to create and attest the confidential VM do not prohibitively increase boot times (from 10.8 to 20.9 seconds) and that confidential VMs with encrypted disks only slightly degrade the CPU and RAM performance (about ) of unmodified applications.},

abstract = {Increasing dynamics and an ever growing number of devices make current and future mobile network infrastructures more and more complex. Managing such networks thus becomes progressively challenging. Introducing more autonomic behavior in network management becomes indispensable to not only handle the growing complexity, but also to make these infrastructures more resilient as they constitute a critical component of overall public infrastructures. Autonomic control planes provide a fundamental set of resilient, autonomic infrastructure services (e.g., connectivity) for higher-level autonomic behavior to build upon. In this demo we show how a first real-world implementation of the routing architecture KIRA provides zero-touch control plane connectivity to enable an autonomic 5G network infrastructure. The demonstrator allows an in-depth view of each step in the process of bootstrapping a 5G infrastructure as well as of KIRA's resilience when challenged by failures and dynamics. Based on this autonomic connectivity solution we present our vision of more dynamic and resilient autonomic control networks toward the future design of 6G core networks.},

abstract = {The MPEG DASH standard is widely deployed in over-the-top streaming services. The standard defines two key components: a manifest format to describe the presentation and a set of segment formats to describe the media segments. While the DASH's manifest format, Media Presentation Document (MPD) provides a set of extensive tools to describe the presentation timeline, this document is usually created for a large set of DASH clients and therefore it can be cached in CDNs for a large population. If the MPD needs to be customized per client, the cache efficiency of storing a single MPD for all clients would be lost. Recently the MPEG Systems Working Group (ISO/IEC/SC29/WG3) developed a new standard that allows an MPD to be customized at each client using an external document and a set of processing rules. The first version of the Session-Based DASH standard (ISO/IEC 23009-8) was recently finalized and will be published in the upcoming months.ISO/IEC 23009-8 defines 3 components: 1) A Session-Based Document (SBD) which defines the MPD customization rules for a client for a given session, 2) A method of referencing the external Session-Based Document (SBD) in the DASH MPD, and finally, 3) a processing model for the client-side processing of SBDs. The SBD defines a post-processing procedure to customize each URL generated by the DASH client from an MPD. Before the DASH client requesting to download a resource using that URL, a process that is described in the SBD document is applied to the URL. The process can customize different parts of the URL, i.e. the host, path, port parts as well as its queries, using a template matching technique. The customization can be timed dependent, on the point in the media timeline that the URL corresponds to, or order dependent, i.e., on the location of the URL in the URL request orders. The result is a customized URL per client/session/URL that is produced from the given URL generated by the DASH client from MPD.The ISO/IEC 23009-8 standard defines an architecture for the session-based DASH streaming that has a few benefits: 1) From the content creation side, it separates the client-based and session-based customization from MPD and therefore maintains the MPD caching efficiency while allowing the customization. It also enables to produce customization after packaging of MPD which means that it can be added to the current workflows as a post-processing step. 2) From the client-side, it allows implementation of SBD client as a separate and independent process from the DASH client, and therefore it can be added to the current clients as a separate process. Furthermore, the SBD processing can occur on the device or a different network entity such as application servers. 3) From the content distribution side, the SBD creation or customization can occur at different nodes of the network, at the origin server, as distribution centers and CDNS, or even at the home network gateways. The standard also allows multiple SBDs to be applied to the URLs of an MPD, enabling the customization to be requested by one or multiple entities in the ingest or distribution chain.In this paper, we first describe the session-based DASH streaming architecture. Then the features of the SBD standard are outlined including the capabilities of customizing based on templates as well as the key-pair replacement and the possibilities of replacing various parts of a URL. Next, the SBD client processing model is described, and how the SBD client can be implemented on the device or as a network entity as a separate process. Finally, we demonstrate a forensic watermarking application using the SBD and demonstrate its capabilities and compare the efficiency of watermarking using the SBD standard vs the MPD customization per client/session.},

abstract = {Path-aware networking has introduced new possibilities to monitor and control network access and solved a multitude of modern-day Internet security issues. Being able to authorize usage of specific paths enables network operators to offer high-quality services to customers requiring highly reliable network access.Currently, securing a network path or an end host is only possible by using high-level solutions like VPNs. With EPIC-HP (Every Packet Is Checked - Hidden Path), it has been shown that it is possible to move this functionality down into the network itself. EPIC-HP extends the path-aware Internet architecture SCION by offering per-packet checksums, adding authentication to network traffic. This is used to combat DoS attacks on the network's end hosts and give high-priority access to specific end users. In this paper, we show that it is possible to implement the functionality of EPIC-HP along with SCION on the Intel Tofino 2 ASIC. EPIC-HP requires AES-based MAC verification with per-path keys in the data plane. By using the multi-pipeline structure of the Tofino, we implemented the required AES and AES-CMAC cryptography using three pipes of the switch's total four independent pipes.The throughput we achieve is an order of magnitude above the data rates previously achieved for EPIC-HP and is a significant step towards a more secure Internet.},

abstract = {The wide adoption of digital technologies in the cultural heritage sector has promoted the emergence of new, distributed ways of working, communicating, and investigating cultural products and services. In particular, collaborative online platforms and crowdsourcing mechanisms have been widely adopted in the effort to solicit input from the community and promote engagement. In this work, we provide an extensive analysis of the Wiki Loves Monuments initiative, an annual, international photography contest in which volunteers are invited to take pictures of the built cultural heritage and upload them to Wikimedia Commons. We explore the geographical, temporal, and topical dimensions across the 2010–2021 editions. We first adopt a set of CNN-based artificial systems that allow the learning of deep scene features for various scene recognition tasks, exploring cross-country (dis)similarities. To overcome the rigidity of the framework based on scene descriptors, we train a deep convolutional neural network model to label a photo with its country of origin. The resulting model captures the best representation of a heritage site uploaded in a country, and it allows the domain experts to explore the complexity of cross-national architectural styles. Finally, as a validation step, we explore the link between architectural heritage and intangible cultural values, operationalized using the framework developed within the World Value Survey research program. We observe that cross-country cultural similarities match to a fair extent the interrelations emerging in the architectural domain. We think this study contributes to highlighting the richness and the potential of the Wikimedia data and tools ecosystem to act as a scientific object for art historians, iconologists, and archaeologists.},
