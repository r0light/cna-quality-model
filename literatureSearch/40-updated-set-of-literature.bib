  abstract = {The landscape for cloud services and cyberinfrastructure offerings has increased drastically over the past few years. Initially, users moved their applications to the cloud to take advantage of a pay-per-usage model and on-demand access. However, as more cloud providers joined the market, users shifted their goals for using cloud computing from cost reduction to resilience, agility, and optimization. These goals can be achieved by dynamically combining services from multiple providers, for example, to avoid data center or cloud zone outages or to take advantage of extensive offerings with different price points. However, to efficiently support application deployment in this dynamic environment, new models and tools that can measure the application performance and the Quality of Service (QoS) of different configurations are required. The goal of this work is to evaluate the application performance and the QoS of a distributed Software-Defined Environment as well as calculate the QoS of alternative configurations from the underlying pool of services. In particular, we present a mathematical model and a tool for evaluating the performance and QoS of batch application workflows in a distributed environment. We experimentally evaluate the proposed model using a bioinformatics workflow running on infrastructure services from multiple cloud providers.},

that cloud providers account on a pay-per-use basis. Elasticity management systems
provision these resources autonomously to deal with changing workload. Such changing
workloads call for new objective metrics allowing architects to quantify quality properties
like scalability, elasticity, and efficiency, e.g., for requirements/SLO engineering
and software design analysis. In literature, initial metrics for these properties
have been proposed. However, current metrics lack a systematic derivation and assume
knowledge of implementation details like resource handling. Therefore, these metrics
are inapplicable where such knowledge is unavailable.To cope with these lacks, this
short paper derives metrics for scalability, elasticity, and efficiency properties
of cloud computing systems using the goal question metric (GQM) method. Our derivation
uses a running example that outlines characteristics of cloud computing systems. Eventually,
this example allows us to set up a systematic GQM plan and to derive an initial set
of six new metrics. We particularly show that our GQM plan allows to classify existing
metrics.},

  abstract  = {Microservice-based architectures are gaining popularity for their benefits in software development. Distributed tracing can be used to help operators maintain observability in this highly distributed context, and find problems such as latency, and analyse their context and root cause. However, exploring and working with distributed tracing data is sometimes difficult due to its complexity and application specificity, volume of information and lack of tools. The most common and general tools available for this kind of data, focus on trace-level human-readable data visualisation. Unfortunately, these tools do not provide good ways to abstract, navigate, filter and analyse tracing data. Additionally, they do not automate or aid with trace analysis, relying on administrators to do it themselves. In this paper we propose using tracing data to extract service metrics, dependency graphs and work-flows with the objective of detecting anomalous services and operation patterns. We implemented and published open source prototype tools to process tracing data, conforming to the OpenTracing standard, and developed anomaly detection methods. We validated our tools and methods against real data provided by a major cloud provider. Results show that there is an underused wealth of actionable information that can be extracted from both metric and morphological aspects derived from tracing. In particular, our tools were able to detect anomalous behaviour and situate it both in terms of involved services, work-flows and time-frame. Furthermore, we identified some limitations of the OpenTracing format—as well as the industry accepted tracing abstractions—, and provide suggestions to test trace quality and enhance the standard.},

Especially in the context of microservices, decentralization and technological heterogeneity may pose challenges for static analysis. We therefore propose the modular and extensible RAMA approach (RESTful API Metric Analyzer) to calculate such metrics from machine-readable interface descriptions of RESTful services. We also provide prototypical tool support, the RAMA CLI, which currently parses the formats OpenAPI, RAML, and WADL and calculates 10 structural service-based metrics proposed in scientific literature. To make RAMA measurement results more actionable, we additionally designed a repeatable benchmark for quartile-based threshold ranges (green, yellow, orange, red). In an exemplary run, we derived thresholds for all RAMA CLI metrics from the interface descriptions of 1,737 publicly available RESTful APIs. Researchers and practitioners can use RAMA to evaluate the maintainability of RESTful services or to support the empirical evaluation of new service interface metrics.},

Measuring the maintainability of software is therefore crucial for the long-term management

enterprise software, we present a holistic overview of such metrics specifically designed
for this type of system, since traditional metrics - e.g. object-oriented ones - are
not fully applicable in this case. The selected metric candidates from the literature
review were mapped to 4 dominant design properties: size, complexity, coupling, and
cohesion. Microservice-based Systems (μSBSs) emerge as an agile and fine-grained variant
of SBSs. While the majority of identified metrics are also applicable to this specialization
(with some limitations), the large number of services in combination with technological
heterogeneity and decentralization of control significantly impacts automatic metric
collection in such a system. Our research therefore suggest that specialized tool
support is required to guarantee the practical applicability of the presented metrics
to μSBSs.},

years given the increased need to scale, grow and flexibilize software projects accompanied

submitted to a process of migration from its monolithic architecture to a more modular,
scalable and flexible architecture of microservices. This process is slow and, depending

proposes a new approach on microservice identification by resorting to topic modelling
in order to identify services according to domain terms. This approach in combination
with clustering techniques produces a set of services based on the original software.
The proposed methodology is implemented as an open-source tool for exploration of
monolithic architectures and identification of microservices. A quantitative analysis
using the state of the art metrics on independence of functionality and modularity
of services was conducted on 200 open-source projects collected from GitHub. Cohesion
at message and domain level metrics' showed medians of roughly 0.6. Interfaces per
service exhibited a median of 1.5 with a compact interquartile range. Structural and
conceptual modularity revealed medians of 0.2 and 0.4 respectively.Our first results
are positive demonstrating beneficial identification of services due to overall metrics'

The services are implemented and managed independently from each other. Breaking up monolithic structures into a microservice architecture increases the number of single components massively. Thus, effective management of the dependencies between them is required. This task can be supported with the creation and evaluation of architectural models. In this work, we propose an evaluation approach for microservice architectures based on identified architecture principles from research and practice like a small size of the services, a domain-driven design or loose coupling. Based on a study showing the challenges in current microservice architectures, we derived principles and metrics for the evaluation of the architectural design. The required architecture data is captured with a reverse engineering approach from traces of communication data. The developed tool is finally evaluated within a case study.},

  abstract = {A large number of metrics with which to assess the quality of cloud services have been proposed over the last years. However, this knowledge is still dispersed, and stakeholders have little or no guidance when choosing metrics that will be suitable to evaluate their cloud services. The objective of this paper is, therefore, to systematically identify, taxonomically classify, and compare existing quality of service (QoS) metrics in the cloud computing domain. We conducted a systematic literature review of 84 studies selected from a set of 4333 studies that were published from 2006 to November 2018. We specifically identified 470 metric operationalizations that were then classified using a taxonomy, which is also introduced in this paper. The data extracted from the metrics were subsequently analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings indicated that most metrics evaluate quality attributes related to performance efficiency (64%) and that there is a need for metrics that evaluate other characteristics, such as security and compatibility. The majority of the metrics are used during the Operation phase of the cloud services and are applied to the running service. Our results also revealed that metrics for cloud services are still in the early stages of maturity - only 10% of the metrics had been empirically validated. The proposed taxonomy can be used by practitioners as a guideline when specifying service level objectives or deciding which metric is best suited to the evaluation of their cloud services, and by researchers as a comprehensive quality framework in which to evaluate their approaches.},

FaaS platforms enable developers to define their application only through a set of
service functions, relieving them of infrastructure management tasks, which are executed
automatically by the platform. Since its introduction, FaaS has grown to support workloads
beyond the lightweight use-cases it was originally intended for, and now serves as
a viable paradigm for big data processing. However, several questions regarding FaaS
platform quality are still unanswered. Specifically, the impact of automatic infrastructure
management on serverless big data applications remains unexplored.In this paper, we
propose a novel evaluation method (SIEM) to understand the impact of these tasks.
For this purpose, we introduce new metrics to quantify quality in different big data
application scenarios. We show an application of SIEM by evaluating the four major
FaaS providers, and contribute results and new insights for FaaS-based big data processing.},

has introduced a new layer of complexity to the already challenging task of continuously
delivering changes to the end users. Cloud computing has turned scalable hardware
into a commodity, but also imposes some requirements on the software development process.
Yet, the literature mainly focuses on quantifiable metrics such as number of manual
steps and lines of code required to make a change. The industry, on the other hand,
appears to focus more on qualitative metrics such as increasing the productivity of
their developers. These are common goals, but must be measured using different approaches.
Therefore, based on interviews of industry stakeholders a framework for evaluating
and comparing approaches to continuous microservice delivery is proposed. We show
that it is possible to efficiently evaluate and compare strategies for continuously
delivering microservices.},

  abstract = {Elasticity is a fundamental feature of cloud computing and can be considered as a great advantage and a key benefit of cloud computing. One key challenge in cloud elasticity is lack of consensus on a quantifiable, measurable, observable, and calculable definition of elasticity and systematic approaches to modeling, quantifying, analyzing, and predicting elasticity. Another key challenge in cloud computing is lack of effective ways for prediction and optimization of performance and cost in an elastic cloud platform. The present paper makes the following significant contributions. First, we present a new, quantitative, and formal definition of elasticity in cloud computing, i.e., the probability that the computing resources provided by a cloud platform match the current workload. Our definition is applicable to any cloud platform and can be easily measured and monitored. Furthermore, we develop an analytical model to study elasticity by treating a cloud platform as a queueing system, and use a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model to precisely calculate the elasticity value of a cloud platform by using an analytical and numerical method based on just a few parameters, namely, the task arrival rate, the service rate, the virtual machine start-up and shut-down rates. In addition, we formally define auto-scaling schemes and point out that our model and method can be easily extended to handle arbitrarily sophisticated scaling schemes. Second, we apply our model and method to predict many other important properties of an elastic cloud computing system, such as average task response time, throughput, quality of service, average number of VMs, average number of busy VMs, utilization, cost, cost-performance ratio, productivity, and scalability. In fact, from a cloud consumer's point of view, these performance and cost metrics are even more important than the elasticity metric. Our study in this paper has two significance. On one hand, a cloud service provider can predict its performance and cost guarantee using the results developed in this paper. On the other hand, a cloud service provider can optimize its elastic scaling scheme to deliver the best cost-performance ratio. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that analytically and comprehensively studies elasticity, performance, and cost in cloud computing. Our model and method significantly contribute to the understanding of cloud elasticity and management of elastic cloud computing systems.},

  abstract  = {Evaluating qualities of software based on software structural attributes such as coupling and cohesion are frequently done in practice as these attributes directly have impacts on value of higher level quality. Concerning oneself with structural attributes values early on helps developers to predict quality attributes level in the software. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural concept where services are used as building blocks in developing new software. Lots of structural attributes metrics related to SOA had been proposed these recent years, which triggered an investigation to classify these metrics based on specific criteria. In this paper, we introduce classifications for SOA based structural attributes metrics, where the metrics are restricted to coupling, cohesion and complexity metrics. These metrics are classified based on software static and dynamic aspects with some brief introduction for each metric. By classifying these SOA based structural attributes metrics, it will allow user to avoid redundancy in proposing similar metrics thus increases the reusability of existing metrics.},

  abstract  = {Microservices are the go-to architectural style for building applications that are polyglot, support high scalability, independent development and deployment, and are rapidly adaptable to changes. Among the core tenets for a successful microservice architecture is high independence of the individual microservices, i.e. loose coupling. A number of patterns and best practices are well-established in the literature, but most actual microservice-based systems do not, as a whole or in part, conform to them. Assessing this conformance manually is not realistically possible for large-scale systems. This study aims to provide the foundations for an automated approach for assessing conformance to coupling-related patterns and practices specific for microservice architectures. We propose a model-based assessment based on generic, technology-independent metrics, connected to typical design decisions encountered in microservice architectures. We demonstrate and assess the validity and appropriateness of these metrics by performing an assessment of the conformance of real-world systems to patterns through statistical methods.},

One among them is Service Oriented Architecture(SOA) which has created significant impact the way software applications are built. There are many implementations of SOA like Web Services, REST services etc. But Web Services and REST services do not fully follow all the principles of SOA. Microservices as an architectural style recently emerged from SOA by which we can develop business requirements with loosely coupled, self deploying and scalable services. Microservices have gained more popularity in application development as they are easy to understand, scale and deploy. In this paper we discuss principles of SOA, major drawbacks of web services and benefits of Microservices over SOA based web services. We have highlighted the importance of Microservices in software development. This paper gives information for architects as to why choose Microservices architecture over web services. We have also discussed metrics used for calculating Coupling between services and we evaluated by considering a smart payment application for ecommerce which is built using both the styles. We observed that Microservices architectural style has less coupling between services compared to Web Service style based on the metric values of the application.},

  abstract  = {Distributed systems have evolved rapidly as the demand for independent design and deployment of software applications has increased. Web services and microservices are two styles of designing distributed applications based on the principles of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). After the evolution of microservices, software architects are in chaos, whether to adopt microservices over web services. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no empirical work done in the literature for comparing both web services and microservices architecture in terms of the coupling principle of SOA. In this paper, a service graph-based approach is proposed to analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of microservices architecture when compared with web services. Loose coupling is used as a perspective for evaluation, and we have chosen two case study applications to evaluate them in terms of coupling. From the results, it is observed that microservices has lesser coupling values than web services.},

  abstract  = {Microservice is an architectural style that proposes that a complex system should be developed from small and independent services that work together. There is not a welldefined boundary about when a software architecture can be considered based on microservices or not. Because of that, defining microservices context and infrastructure is challenging, especially to characterize aspects related to microservice size, data consistency, and microservices coupling. Thus, it is crucial to understand the microservices-based software characteristics, to comprehend the impact of some evolutions on architecture, and evaluate how much a particular architecture fits the microservices architectural style. Therefore, based on bibliographic research and case studies conducted in academical and industrial environments, we aim to propose a model to characterize the architecture structure based on the main guidelines of the microservice architectural style. This model introduces dimensions that measure characteristics based on modules size, coupling to data sources, and service collaboration. This study should facilitate the mapping, measurement, and monitoring of different impacts generated in the software architecture from increments and refactoring performed. This work is on the initial development stage and as a result, we expected that the model supports architectural decisions that consider different quality attributes to achieve the right balance between service independence and collaboration for a given system.},

  abstract  = {The recent years have witnessed significant interest in migrating different applications into the cloud platforms. In this context, one of the main challenges for cloud applications providers is how to ensure high availability of the delivered applications while meeting users’ QoS. In this respect, replication techniques are commonly applied to efficiently handle this issue. From the literature, according to the used granularity for replication there are two major approaches to achieve replication: either through replicating the service or the underlying data. The latter one is also known as Data-oriented Replication (DoR), while the former one is referred to as Service-oriented Replication (SoR). DoR is discussed extensively in the available literature and several surveys are already published. However, SoR is still at its infancy and there is a lack of research studies. Hence, in this paper we present a comprehensive survey of SoR strategies in cloud computing. We propose a classification of existing works based on the research methods they use. Then, we carried out an in-depth study and analysis of these works. In addition, a tabular representation of all relevant features is presented to facilitate the comparison of SoR techniques and the proposal of new enhanced strategies.},

architecture. Rather than developing a system from scratch, component-based software
development emphasizes the integration of these components according to the user's
requirements and specifications. In component-based software, the components interact
to access and provide services and functionality to each other. Currently, the emphasis
of industry and researchers is on developing impressive and efficient metrics and
measurement tools to analyze the interaction complexity among these components. To
represent the request and the response of services among components, we have used
outgoing edges and incoming edges respectively. In this paper we have defined these
interactions as In-Interactions and Out-Interactions. The metrics proposed in this
paper are solely based on the interactions among the components. In this work some
simple methods and metrics for computing the complexity of composable components are
suggested. The metrics discussed in this paper include the computation of interaction
complexities as Total-Interactions of a component, Total- Interactions of component-based
software, Interaction-Ratio of a component, Interaction-Ratio of component-based software,
Average- Interaction among components and Interaction-Percentage of components.},

  abstract  = {Microservice-based software architecture design has been widely discussed, and best practices have been published as architecture design patterns. However, conformance to those patterns is hard to ensure and assess automatically, leading to problems such as architectural drift and erosion, especially in the context of continued software evolution or large-scale microservice systems. In addition, not much in the component and connector architecture models is specific (only) to the microservices approach, whereas other aspects really specific to that approach, such as independent deployment of microservices, are usually modeled in other views or not at all. We suggest a set of constraints to check and metrics to assess architecture conformance to microservice patterns. In comparison to expert judgment derived from the patterns, a subset of these constraints and metrics shows a good relative performance and potential for automation.},

Also, the lack of empirically-validated cohesion metrics for MSA makes the quantitative assessment even more challenging. In this paper, we empirically explore the practical applicability of service-level cohesion metrics in an open-source MSA application context. The qualitative results show the possibility of assessing MSA cohesion using these service-level metrics, the feasibility of tracking software evolution, and an indication of possible technical debts along the way.},

  abstract  = {Microservice architecture design highly relies on expert experience and may often result in improper service decomposition. Moreover, a microservice architecture is likely to degrade with the continuous evolution of services. Architecture measurement is thus important for the long-term evolution of microservice architectures. Due to the independent and dynamic nature of services, source code analysis based approaches cannot well capture the interactions between services. In this paper, we propose a trace analysis based microservice architecture measurement approach. We define a trace data model for microservice architecture measurement, which enables fine-grained analysis of the execution processes of requests and the interactions between interfaces and services. Based on the data model, we define 14 architectural metrics to measure the service independence and invocation chain complexity of a microservice system. We implement the approach and conduct three case studies with a student course project, an open-source microservice benchmark system, and three industrial microservice systems. The results show that our approach can well characterize the independence and invocation chain complexity of microservice architectures and help developers to identify microservice architecture issues caused by improper service decomposition and architecture degradation.},

  abstract  = {Container orchestration frameworks play a critical role in modern cloud computing paradigms such as cloud-native or serverless computing. They significantly impact the quality and cost of service deployment as they manage many performance-critical tasks such as container provisioning, scheduling, scaling, and networking. Consequently, a comprehensive performance assessment of container orchestration frameworks is essential. However, until now, there is no benchmarking approach that covers the many different tasks implemented in such platforms and supports evaluating different technology stacks. In this paper, we present a systematic approach that enables benchmarking of container orchestrators. Based on a definition of container orchestration, we define the core requirements and benchmarking scope for such platforms. Each requirement is then linked to metrics and measurement methods, and a benchmark architecture is proposed. With COFFEE, we introduce a benchmarking tool supporting the definition of complex test campaigns for container orchestration frameworks. We demonstrate the potential of our approach with case studies of the frameworks Kubernetes and Nomad in a self-hosted environment and on the Google Cloud Platform. The presented case studies focus on container startup times, crash recovery, rolling updates, and more.},

  abstract = {Microservices are becoming a more popular software architecture among companies and developers. Therefore, there is a need to develop methods for quantifying the process of measuring the quality of microservices design. This paper has created a novel set of metrics for microservices architecture applications. The proposed metrics are the Service Granularity Metric “SGM”, the Lack of Cohesion Metric “LCOM”, and the Number of Operations “NOO”. The proposed metrics measure the granularity, cohesion, and complexity of individual microservices through analyzing the application programming interface “API”. Using these metrics, it is possible to evaluate the overall quality of the design of microservices applications. The proposed metrics were measured on 5 applications with different sizes and business cases. This research found that the value for the SGM metric needs to be between 0.2 and 0.6. Besides, the value of LCOM metric for a microservice needs to be between 0 and 0.8 with less than ten operations per microservice. These findings can be applied in the decomposition process of monolithic applications as well.},

Therefore, some metrics and policies for measuring the quality of an application which is based on microservice architecture is needed. Moreover, automated tools are needed to carry out those tasks and enforce those policies. This work represents such metrics and policies.

Unlike the traditional monolith applications, MSA applications are composed of many services hence there is an immense possibility of anti-patterns introduced into the system. To identify these design problems, a detailed analysis of the architecture needs to be performed. We see great potential for adopting graph concepts and algorithms in this regard. However, the few tools proposed by existing work to find anti-patterns that adopt graph concepts are not up to providing developers with adequate statistical information such as metrics along with visualization techniques or they are not fully automated. In this research, we present a tool-based solution for this problem which is capable of utilizing traced data of an MSA system to generate dependency graphs and thereby extract metrics using graph theory concepts and algorithms. We analyze a sample MSA system for anti-patterns with the tool. To verify the usability of the tool further, a group of developers also analyze an open-source system with the tool.},

  abstract = {Microservices architecture has gained significant traction, in part owing to its potential to deliver scalable, robust, agile, and failure-resilient software products. Consequently, many companies that use large and complex software systems are actively looking for automated solutions to decompose their monolith applications into microservices. This paper rigorously examines 35 research papers selected from well-known databases using a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) protocol and snowballing method, extracting data to answer the research questions, and presents the following four contributions. First, the Monolith to Microservices Decomposition Framework (M2MDF) which identifies the major phases and key elements of decomposition. Second, a detailed analysis of existing decomposition approaches, tools and methods. Third, we identify the metrics and datasets used to evaluate and validate monolith to microservice decomposition processes. Fourth, we propose areas for future research. Overall, the findings suggest that monolith decomposition into microservices remains at an early stage and there is an absence of methods for combining static, dynamic, and evolutionary data. Insufficient tool support is also in evidence. Furthermore, standardised metrics, datasets, and baselines have yet to be established. These findings can assist practitioners seeking to understand the various dimensions of monolith decomposition and the community's current capabilities in that endeavour. The findings are also of value to researchers looking to identify areas to further extend research in the monolith decomposition space.},

Securing microservice architectures is challenging because of their polyglot nature, continuous evolution, and various security concerns relevant to such architectures. This article proposes a novel, model-based approach providing detection strategies to address the automated detection of security tactics (or patterns and best practices) in a given microservice architecture decomposition model. Our novel detection strategies are metrics-based rules that decide conformance to a security recommendation based on a statistical predictor. The proposed approach models this recommendation using Architectural Design Decisions (ADDs). We apply our approach for four different security-related ADDs on access management, traffic control, and avoiding plaintext sensitive data in the context of microservice systems. We then apply our approach to a model data set of 10 open-source microservice systems and 20 variants of those systems. Our results are detection strategies showing a very low bias, a very high correlation, and a low prediction error in our model data set.},

  abstract  = {Microservices are a commonly used architectural style targeting independent development, deployment, and release of services, as well as supporting polyglot capabilities and rapid release strategies. This depends on the presence of certain software architecture qualities. A number of architecture patterns and best practices that support the required qualities have been proposed in the literature, but usually in isolation of one another. Additionally, in real-world systems, assessing conformance to these patterns and practices and detecting possible violations is a significant challenge. For small-scale systems of a few services, a manual assessment and violation detection by an expert is probably both accurate and sufficient. However, for industrial-scale systems of several hundred or more services, manual assessment and violation detection is laborious and likely leads to inaccurate results. Furthermore, manual assessment is impractical for rapidly evolving and frequently released system architectures. In this work we examine a subset of microservice-relevant patterns, and propose a method for the semi-automatic detection and resolution of conformance violations. Our aim is to assist the software architect by providing a set of possible fix options and generating models of “fixed” architectures.},
