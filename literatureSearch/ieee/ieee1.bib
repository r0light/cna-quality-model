abstract={The Software Engineering community has defined different types of architectures to build applications. One among them is Service Oriented Architecture(SOA) which has created significant impact the way software applications are built. There are many implementations of SOA like Web Services, REST services etc. But Web Services and REST services do not fully follow all the principles of SOA. Microservices as an architectural style recently emerged from SOA by which we can develop business requirements with loosely coupled, self deploying and scalable services. Microservices have gained more popularity in application development as they are easy to understand, scale and deploy. In this paper we discuss principles of SOA, major drawbacks of web services and benefits of Microservices over SOA based web services. We have highlighted the importance of Microservices in software development. This paper gives information for architects as to why choose Microservices architecture over web services. We have also discussed metrics used for calculating Coupling between services and we evaluated by considering a smart payment application for ecommerce which is built using both the styles. We observed that Microservices architectural style has less coupling between services compared to Web Service style based on the metric values of the application.},

abstract={Microservice is an architectural style that proposes that a complex system should be developed from small and independent services that work together. There is not a welldefined boundary about when a software architecture can be considered based on microservices or not. Because of that, defining microservices context and infrastructure is challenging, especially to characterize aspects related to microservice size, data consistency, and microservices coupling. Thus, it is crucial to understand the microservices-based software characteristics, to comprehend the impact of some evolutions on architecture, and evaluate how much a particular architecture fits the microservices architectural style. Therefore, based on bibliographic research and case studies conducted in academical and industrial environments, we aim to propose a model to characterize the architecture structure based on the main guidelines of the microservice architectural style. This model introduces dimensions that measure characteristics based on modules size, coupling to data sources, and service collaboration. This study should facilitate the mapping, measurement, and monitoring of different impacts generated in the software architecture from increments and refactoring performed. This work is on the initial development stage and as a result, we expected that the model supports architectural decisions that consider different quality attributes to achieve the right balance between service independence and collaboration for a given system.},

abstract={Monolith applications tend to be difficult to deploy, upgrade, maintain, and understand. Microservices, on the other hand, have the advantages of being independently developed, tested, deployed, scaled and, more importantly, easier to change and maintain. This paper addresses the problem of migrating a monolith to a microservices architecture. Therefore, we address two research questions: (1) Can we define the cost of decomposition in terms of the effort to redesign a functionality, which is implemented in the monolith as an ACID transaction, into several distributed transactions? (2) Considering several similarity measures between domain entities, which provide a better decomposition when they are compared using the proposed complexity metric? To answer the first research question, we propose a complexity metric, for each functionality of the monolith application, that measures the impact of relaxing the functionality consistency on the architecture redesign and implementation. Regarding the second research question, we experiment with four similarity measures, each based on a different type of information collected from monolith functionality implementation. We evaluated our approach with three monolith systems and compared our complexity metric against industry metrics of cohesion and coupling. We also evaluated the different similarity measures in terms of the complexity of the decomposition they produce. We were able to correctly correlate the complexity metric with other metrics of cohesion and coupling defined in other research and we conclude that no single combination of similarity measures outperforms the other, which is confirmed by the existing research. Additionally, we conclude that the approach can help on an incremental migration to microservices, which, actually, is the strategy proposed by the industry experts.},

abstract={The goal of this tutorial is to provide an overview of challenges and approaches for architecture/dependability assessment in the context of DevOps and microservices. Specifically, we present approaches that employ operational data obtained from production-level application performance management (APM) tools, giving access to operational workload profiles, architectural information, failure models, and security intrusions. We use this data to automatically create and conFigure architecture assessments based on models, load tests, and resilience benchmarks. The focus of this tutorial is on approaches that employ production usage, because these approaches provide more accurate recommendations for microservice architecture dependability assessment than approaches that do not consider production usage. We present an overview of (1) the state-of-the-art approaches for obtaining operational data from production systems using APM tools, (2) the challenges of dependability for DevOps and microservices, (3) selected approaches based on operational data to assess dependability. The architecture assessment focus of this tutorial is on scalability, resilience, survivability, and security. Particularly, we present a demo of the automated approach for the evaluation of a domain-based scalability and security metric assessment that is based on the microservice architecture ability to satisfy the performance requirement under load and/or intrusions. We illustrate the approach by presenting experimental results using a benchmark microservice architecture.},

In today's competitive market, enterprises change their business processes frequently. Changes in BPEL process may affect the quality of BPEL process for the consumer. It is desirable to measure and evaluate the BPEL process quality when changes occur. Metrics are vastly used to provide a quantitative measure for the quality. In this paper, BPEL Process Usefulness Metric under Evolution (BUME) is proposed to measure quality of a BPEL process when it evolves. The applicability of the metric is demonstrated using simulated data for different versions of a BPEL process.},

abstract={In service oriented computing, web services are combined to meet the interoperability demands in different heterogeneous and distributed applications. However, incisively measuring the control flow complexity of Web Service Composition (WSC) is not an easy task due to characteristics of distributed, loose-coupling, and heterogeneity. In Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) is used to describe the combination of web services. This paper mainly focuses on the complexity measurement of web service composition from BPEL. Petri-net is one of the models to represent the work flow. The BPEL of WSC is converted into Petri-net based model and by extracting the information of places, transitions, and their interrelationship; the complexity is measured for that Petri-net model. Two metric sets are considered for analysis of the WSC's complexity, which are identified by studying the workflow's execution dependency relations. The first metric set describes the static features, and second metric set describes about the dynamic complexity of business process.},

abstract={Microservices architecture facilitates building distributed scalable software products, usually deployed in a cloud environment. Monitoring microservices deployed in a Kubernetes orchestrated distributed advanced analytics machine learning engines is at the heart of many cloud resource management solutions. In addition, measuring resource utilization at more granular level such as per query or sub-query basis in an MPP Machine Learning Engine (MLE) is key to resource planning and is also the focus of our work. In this paper we propose two mechanisms to measure resource utilization in Teradata Machine Learning Engine (MLE). First mechanism is the Cluster Resource Monitoring (CRM). CRM is a high-level resource measuring mechanism for IT administrators and analytics users to visualize, plot, generates alerts and perform live and historical-analytics on overall cluster usage statistics. Second mechanism is the Query Resource Monitoring (QRM). QRM enables IT administrators and MLE users to measure compute resource utilization per individual query and its sub-queries. When query takes long time, QRM provides insights. This is useful to identify expensive phases within a query that tax certain resources more and skew the work distribution. We show the results of proposed mechanisms and highlight use-cases.},

abstract={Issues that concerns with the inter-operability on a heterogeneous environment can easily be address using the flexible platform of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). Web service is an implementation and modeling of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). Web service description language (WSDL)is a standard describing a web service in XML form. This Description can be categorized in two parts i.e. Structural and non-structural. The readability of a web service helps the consumer to understand it easily, it is suggested to provide sufficient details about functionality scope and limitation of scope in WSDL, so that it can easily be understandable. Readability depends upon interaction of two variables i.e. Text and reader. The maximum details about a web service could lead to it's reproduction by business competitor, and it may helps in maximizing vulnerabilities in it. This paper focuses on a technique for computing readability index by a detail analysis of WSDL document. This readability index obtain using this approach helps the producer of a web service to adjust readability, so that it can easily be understandable by consumer. The better readability index can also leads the provider to a better service discovery. To calculate Readability Index, extraction of WSDL file components was performed. After extraction of key concepts, they were mapped with the Domain Ontology. The words that were not mapped in the ontology, synonyms are employed by consulting the Word Net. Final readability was obtained using Simplified Dale Chall readability index (DaCw). The Web Service Readability can be measure more precisely by considering words that were not found in the mapping process.},

abstract={In recent years, The Internet of Things(IOT) is one of the hottest research topics. It was originally defined as connected all the things through the sensing devices to the Internet. In addition, Service-Oriented methodology has gradually drawn people's attention. Therefore, integrated The IOT with Service-Oriented methodology is very important. But now IOT service composition is mostly synchronous and service model is more complex. RESTful web services have been widely recognized and used because of their lightweight and succinct. RESTful web services introduce a new kind of abstraction, the resource, so that they are hard to compose using the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL). In order to compose asynchronous RESTful web services and make use of various IOT services, this paper proposes an asynchronous RESTful web service recursive measure, which is based on the BPEL extention. First, design the architecture of IOT RESTful web services, the architecture is divided into six layers so that it can integrate The IOT and RESTful web services effectively. Second, we show how to invoke the RESTful web services from the IOT and publish a BPEL process as a RESTful web service by extending BPEL. Finally, through an experiment to verify the correctness and validity of the proposed method in this paper.},

abstract={To meet the need for sustainable development, Taiwan has been spreading a network of micro-monitoring stations to measure the environmental quality in rivers and air to protect people from environmental pollution. As a result, more and more information technology companies develop Internet of Things (IoT) services for this job. However, most IoT services are screened out of the market because lacking design thinking. Therefore, including users’ desires in IoT products and services is a critical determinant for their survival in this permanently changing market. Thus, this study proposed a systematic framework to identify the users’ desires from different stakeholders to determine technological development. For this, we use the Evaluation Grid Method (EGM) to explore the users’ desires by a series of in-depth interviews and visualize the user’s response as a hierarchical evaluation map of attraction. After that, an IoT prototype is built and used to capture the insightful feedback of respondents. Meanwhile, we adopt the minimum viable product (MVP) design principles to develop two prototypes that manage a wastewater treatment plant and household environment. Overall, this study proposes an applicable user integration procedure to help IT engineers develop the IoT for sustainable service. This study also confirms that the MVP method can help to accelerate user integration. We propose a service-oriented IoT architecture in technology development and develop a decision-making service of human dispatch in operating environmental facilities and a context-awareness service for environmental control.},

abstract={Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a widely adopted software engineering paradigm that encourages modular and reusable applications. One popular application of SOA is web service composition, which aims to loosely couple web services to accommodate complex goals not achievable through any individual web service. Many approaches have been proposed to construct composite services with optimized Quality of Service (QoS), assuming that QoS of web services never changes. However, the constructed composite services may not perform well and may not be executable later due to its component services' failure. Therefore, it is important to build composite services that are robust to stochastic service failures. Two challenges of building robust composite services are to efficiently generate service composition with near-optimal quality in a large search space of available services and to accurately measure the robustness of composite services considering all possible failure scenarios. This article proposes a novel two-stage GA-based approach to robust web service composition with an adaptive evolutionary control and an efficient robustness measurement. This approach can generate robust composite service at the design phase, which can cope with stochastic service failures and maintain high quality at the time of execution. We have conducted experiments with benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of our proposed approach. Our experiments show that our method can produce highly robust composite services, achieving outstanding performance consistently in the event of stochastic service failures, on service repositories with varying sizes.},

Different analyses are used to support the architect during project planning. Gap and impact analysis are used to ensure the change consistency. The compliance with the current strategy is finally evaluated with view generation and metric calculation.

SOA adoption is prerequisite for organization to excel their service deliveries, as the delivery platforms are shifting to mobile, cloud and social media. A maturity model is a tool to accelerate enterprise SOA adoption, however it depends on how it should be applied. This paper presents a literature review of existing maturity models and proposes 5 major aspects that a maturity model has to address to improve SOA practices of an enterprise. A maturity model can be used as: (i) a roadmap for SOA adoption, (ii) a reference guide for SOA adoption, (iii) a tool to gauge maturity of process execution, (iv) a tool to measure the effectiveness of SOA motivations, and (v) a review tool for governance framework. This paper also sheds light on how SOA maturity assessment can be modeled. A model for SOA process execution maturity and perspective maturity assessment has been proposed along with a framework to include SOA scope of adoption.},

abstract={The microservices architectural style is picking up more and more momentum in IT industry for the development of systems as loosely coupled, collaborating services. Companies that undergo the migration of their own applications have aspirations such as increasing maintainability and the scale of operation. Such a process is worthwhile but not easy, since it should ensure atomic improvements to the overall architecture for each migration step. Furthermore, the systematic evaluation of migration steps becomes cumbersome without sensible optimization metrics that take into account performance and scalability under expected operational conditions. Recent lines of research recognize this task as challenging, especially in data-intensive applications where known approaches based, for instance, on Domain Driven Design may not be adequate. In this paper, we introduce an approach to evaluate a migration in an iterative way and recognize whether it represents an improvement in terms of performance and scalability. The approach leverages a Domain Metric-based analysis to quantitatively evaluate alternative architectures. We exemplified the envisioned approach on a data-intensive application case study in the domain of smart mobility. Preliminary results from our controlled experiments show the effectiveness of our approach to support systematic and automated evaluation of migration processes.},

abstract={Implementing Business Processes (BPs) with services (and microservices) is nowadays the main way to support the execution of automated activities in processes, both within the organization itself, and externally interacting with customers, suppliers and other participants. In order to do so, it is important not only to model and implement services but also to define Quality of Service (QoS) characteristics for services, to monitor and evaluate their execution. Although there are many proposals for services monitoring and evaluation from the services point of view, there are not many from the BPs perspective. In this paper we present a reference architecture for service monitoring tools, along with a prototype implementation as an extension of the web services execution environment AXIS2. We show that existing service measures and new ones can be defined into the monitor to collect execution data and relate this data with BPs execution, to measure BPs and service execution in an integrated manner.},

abstract={Evaluating qualities of software based on software structural attributes such as coupling and cohesion are frequently done in practice as these attributes directly have impacts on value of higher level quality. Concerning oneself with structural attributes values early on helps developers to predict quality attributes level in the software. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural concept where services are used as building blocks in developing new software. Lots of structural attributes metrics related to SOA had been proposed these recent years, which triggered an investigation to classify these metrics based on specific criteria. In this paper, we introduce classifications for SOA based structural attributes metrics, where the metrics are restricted to coupling, cohesion and complexity metrics. These metrics are classified based on software static and dynamic aspects with some brief introduction for each metric. By classifying these SOA based structural attributes metrics, it will allow user to avoid redundancy in proposing similar metrics thus increases the reusability of existing metrics.},

abstract={Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is one of the most well-known models for designing web systems. SOA system evolution and maintenance is challenging because of its distributive nature and secondly due to the demand of designing high-quality, stable interfaces. This evolution leads to a problem called Anti-patterns in web services. It is observed that these anti-patterns negatively impact the evolution and maintenance of software systems, making the early detection and correction of them a primary concern for the software developers. The primary motivation of this work is to investigate the relationship between the Web Service Description Language(WSDL) metrics and anti-patterns in web services. This research aims to develop an automatic method for the detection of web service anti-patterns. The core idea of the methodology defined is to identify the most crucial WSDL metrics with the association of various feature selection techniques for the prediction of anti-patterns. Experimental results show that the model developed by using all the WSDL quantity metrics(AM) shows a bit high performance compared to the models developed with the other metric sets. Experimental results also showed that the performance of the models generated using Decision Tree(DT) and Major Voting Ensemble(MVE) is high compared to the models generated using other classifier techniques.},

abstract={Web service technologies are playing an increasingly important role in service-oriented architecture design and application convergence over Mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). Due to the decentralized administration and dynamic wireless connectivity problems, accomplishing reliable service discovery in MANET faces a large number of challenges. In order to relieve the communication inefficiency among service providers and clients caused mainly by the unpredictable node mobility, this paper proposes a cross-layer service discovery scheme which enables improved network efficiency and reduced resource consumption. Firstly a network-layer based underlay framework is presented. It specifically establishes a reliability-oriented source routing mechanism which is equipped with a novel reliability-maximized path selection metric and a backup path support fast route recovery strategy. The cross-layer design is prudentially realized by piggybacking service discovery procedures on the reliability enhanced underlay routing mechanism. Simulation analysis verifies that the proposed scheme improves service discovery reliability by achieving low rediscovery frequency, and guarantees high network efficiency by providing reduced service discovery delay and control overhead.},

abstract={Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is becoming popular since its flexibility fulfill the need of rapidly changing enterprise requirement. Therefore, expectation of a good quality software with SOA is getting higher. To address this need, this paper presents a guideline to conduct quality assessment using an existing tool. The quality assessment model is designed by selecting the relevant quality factors, choosing an appropriate quality to metric mapping method, identifying the relevant metrics, and mapping each quality factor to the metrics. Using the model, the quality assessment process is prepared by identifying data and selecting the appropriate tools. The chosen tool may require some modification. The proposed quality assessment guideline can help the software quality assurance team to assess quality of their software with SOA. The proposed guideline has been used to assess the quality of an existing sofware with SOA (Bonita BPM). The result is considered as promising, although several improvement are still needed.},

Implementation of SOA solution in private sector is widely used and successfully proven to increase their profit. But there are different challenge in public sector which is not profit oriented and has different business model. In public sector, user satisfaction on government agencies is one of common indicator to measure quality of public service. This paper presents SOA solution for public sector using SOMA to conduct a service integration for optimizing public satisfaction. We also combined SWOT and Porter's Value Chain to support business modelling analysis. The result shows that there is a simplicity and feasibility for users to access the service after SOA integration, which improves user satisfaction.},

We have seen that evidence theory is utilized to measure uncertainty in terms of the uncertain measures of belief and plausibility. It is also witnessed in computing community that Cloud computing has provided a flexible and scalable infrastructures to grow beyond contemporary borders to the organizations as wells the users everyday use of services.

abstract={In service oriented architectures, components provide services on their output ports and consume services from other components on their input ports. Thereby, a component is said to depend on another component if the former consumes a service provided by the latter. This notion of dependency (which we call syntactic dependency) is used by many architecture analysis tools as a measure for system maintainability. With this paper, we introduce a weaker notion of dependency, still sufficient, however, to guarantee semantic independence between components. Thereby, we discover the concepts of weak and strong semantic dependency and prove that strong semantic dependency indeed implies syntactic dependency. Our alternative notion of dependency paves the way to more precise dependency analysis tools. Moreover, our results about the different types of dependencies can be used for the verification of semantic independence.},

abstract={In recent years, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) has been increasingly adopted to develop distributed applications in the context of the Internet. To develop reliable SOA-based applications, an important issue is how to ensure the quality of web services. In this paper, we propose a dynamic random testing (DRT) technique for web services, which is an improvement over the widely-practiced random testing (RT) and partition testing (PT). We examine key issues when adapting DRT to the context of SOA, including a framework, guidelines for parameter settings, and a prototype for such an adaptation. Empirical studies are reported where DRT is used to test three real-life web services, and mutation analysis is employed to measure the effectiveness. Our experimental results show that, compared with the three baseline techniques, RT, Adaptive Testing (AT) and Random Partition Testing (RPT), DRT demonstrates higher fault-detection effectiveness with a lower test case selection overhead. Furthermore, the theoretical guidelines of parameter setting for DRT are confirmed to be effective. The proposed DRT and the prototype provide an effective and efficient approach for testing web services.},

abstract={NATO has identified the WS-Notification standard from OASIS to support event-driven communication in the NATO enterprise and when building coalition networks. Using this standard promotes interoperability. However, there is significant overhead associated with WS-Notification since it is built on SOAP Web services (WS). Overhead can be problematic in networks with scarce resources. In this paper we perform a small-scale comparative evaluation of overhead of WS-Notification with another publish/subscribe standard: Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT). We also measure how these standards compare to the novel approach of content-based networking under the same networking conditions. We use the Named Data Networking (NDN) flavor of content-based networking for our experiment. Though fundamentally different, these approaches can be used to realize the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) paradigm. The drawback of standard publish/subscribe approaches is that they usually rely on a broker, which constitutes a single point of failure. NDN, on the other hand, has no broker which makes it interesting to consider for tactical networks. We use NATO Friendly Force Information (NFFI), which is much used for friendly force tracking, as the data format for the payload in all our tests. In the paper we focus on the respective approaches' network resource consumption. Based on the results we argue that the content-based approach seems promising and should be investigated further.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) data analytics is underpinning numerous applications, however, the task is still challenging predominantly due to heterogeneous IoT data streams, unreliable networks, and ever increasing size of the data. In this context, we propose a two-layer architecture for analyzing IoT data. The first layer provides a generic interface using a service oriented gateway to ingest data from multiple interfaces and IoT systems, store it in a scalable manner and analyze it in real-time to extract high-level events; whereas second layer is responsible for probabilistic fusion of these high-level events. In the second layer, we extend state-of-the-art event processing using Bayesian networks in order to take uncertainty into account while detecting complex events. We implement our proposed solution using open source components optimized for large-scale applications. We demonstrate our solution on real-world use-case in the domain of intelligent transportation system where we analyzed traffic, weather, and social media data streams from Madrid city in order to predict probability of congestion in real-time. The performance of the system is evaluated qualitatively using a web-interface where traffic administrators can provide the feedback about the quality of predictions and quantitatively using F-measure with an accuracy of over 80%.},

abstract={Today, process-aware systems are ubiquitous. They are built by leveraging process languages for both business and implementation perspectives. In the typical context of a Web Services-based Service-oriented Architecture, the obvious choice to implement service orchestrations is still the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL). For BPEL, a variety of open source and commercial engines have emerged. Although the BPEL standard document defines a set of static analysis rules which should be checked by engines prior to deployment to be standard conformant, previous work revealed that most engines are not capable of revealing all violations of these constraints, resulting in costly runtime errors later on. In this paper, we aim to improve the static analysis conformance of BPEL engines. We implement the tool BPELlint that validates 71 static analysis rules of the BPEL specification, show that the tool can be easily integrated into the deployment process of existing engines, and evaluate its performance to measure the effect on the time to deploy. The results demonstrate that BPELlint can improve the static analysis conformance of BPEL engines with an acceptable performance overhead.},

abstract={In todays Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) world, software systems are built by composing web services offered by Service Providers (SPs). There are different SPs offering services for the same set of functional requirements. Service providers are expected to be highly competitive in their offerings to enhance their market. The quality of web services is an important factor that differentiates one service provider from another. Twelve parameters are identified by which quality of service can be measured. The prediction of these twelve QoS parameters help SPs to enhance the quality of their service. Each web service is realized by several programming files. CK and object oriented metrics of the underlying Java files of the web services are important features for predicting QoS parameters of the web service. The aggregated measure, mean, is chosen to be a feature in predicting the QoS parameters in earlier studies. We propose to build prediction models using 16 aggregate measures and show that there is significant difference between these aggregate measures. We find best feature subset using six feature selection techniques and build prediction models using Extreme Learning Machines with different kernels. We show that feature selection techniques might not enhance prediction accuracies and the ensemble algorithm out performs other learning algorithms.},

These advantages are expected to increase the demand for more cloud services which further increase the installation of more clouds and its customer base. These demands lead to many technical issues such as applications of internet services, service oriented architecture including high scalability and availability, fault tolerance. So the core issue is to develop techniques for balancing of load effectively. It is clear from the fact that the measure and complexity makes these systems infeasible for assignment of centralized jobs to specific servers. So there is need of productive distributed solutions. In the current paper three proposed load balancing solutions for distributed environment is investigated. They are biased Random Sampling, Honeybee Foraging and Active Clustering.},
